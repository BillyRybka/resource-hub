<objective>

Revive a stale or fatigued offer using the Variation Hierarchy. Make strategic changes in the right order to extend offer life without destroying what works.

**Input:** An offer that was working but has lost effectiveness
**Output:** Refreshed version with new energy, preserving core value

</objective>

<context>

**Why offers fatigue:**
- Market sees the same messaging repeatedly
- Competitors copy successful elements
- Audience builds "ad blindness"
- Seasonal relevance fades
- The "newness" factor disappears

**The mistake most people make:** Throwing out the whole offer and starting over. This wastes proven components.

**The right approach:** Make the smallest effective change first. Only escalate if needed.

</context>

<intake>

Ask: "Tell me about the offer that's fatiguing:
1. What's the offer? (What do they get, what's the price)
2. How long has it been running?
3. What metrics are declining? (Response rate, conversion, both?)
4. What have you already tried to fix it?
5. Is this the same audience or have you expanded?"

**Diagnostic questions:**
- "When did you first notice the decline?"
- "Did anything change externally? (Competitor launched, market shifted, platform changed)"
- "Is the offer still delivering results for buyers? Or is that declining too?"

</intake>

<process>

## Step 1: Diagnose the Fatigue Type

**Type A: Creative Fatigue**
- Same audience seeing same visuals/videos too many times
- Fix: Level 1-2 changes (creative, copy)

**Type B: Message Fatigue**
- The angle/hook has been overused in market
- Fix: Level 3-4 changes (headline, duration, enhancer)

**Type C: Offer Fatigue**
- The core offer is genuinely tired (been running 1+ years)
- Fix: Level 5-6 changes (monetization structure, new offer)

**Type D: Market Fatigue**
- The market has changed or been saturated
- Fix: New market segment or fundamental repositioning

Ask: "Based on what you've told me, this sounds like [Type] fatigue. Does that match what you're seeing?"

## Step 2: Apply Variation Hierarchy

**THE RULE: Start at Level 1. Only escalate if lower levels don't work.**

### Level 1: Creative (Change First)

What to change:
- Images/thumbnails
- Video style/format
- Visual design elements
- Color schemes
- Font treatments

Examples:
- Static image → Video
- Talking head → B-roll with voiceover
- Clean design → Raw/authentic style
- Professional photos → iPhone screenshots

"Let's start here. What creative have you been running? Can we test a completely different visual approach without changing the words?"

### Level 2: Body Copy

What to change:
- The supporting text (not the headline)
- Story/angle in the copy
- Proof elements emphasized
- Emotional triggers used

Examples:
- Pain-focused → Aspiration-focused
- Logical argument → Story-driven
- Feature list → Single benefit deep dive
- Third-person proof → First-person narrative

"If new creative didn't work, let's rewrite the body copy. Same promise, different story. What angle haven't you tried?"

### Level 3: Headline/Name (M.A.G.I.C. Wrapper)

What to change:
- The main headline
- Offer name
- Primary hook

Keep the core offer the same, just reframe it:

Old: "6-Week Fitness Transformation"
New: "The Busy Professional's 42-Day Body Reset"

"Same offer, new wrapper. Let's use M.A.G.I.C. to create 3 alternative names/headlines."

**M.A.G.I.C. Quick Refresh:**
- M: New magnet (different reason why - seasonal, milestone, event)
- A: Narrower or different avatar segment
- G: Reframe the goal (same outcome, different words)
- I: Change the interval (6-week → 42-day → 2-month)
- C: New container (Challenge → Bootcamp → System → Accelerator)

### Level 4: Duration/Interval

What to change:
- Length of program/delivery
- Pacing of results

Examples:
- 8-week → 21-day intensive
- 90-day → 12-week quarterly
- Ongoing → Defined sprint
- Self-paced → Cohort-based

"Does the current timeframe still make sense? Could you deliver faster? Is there a more compelling interval?"

### Level 5: Enhancer Component

What to change:
- The discount/incentive structure
- Bonus stack
- Guarantee terms
- Scarcity/urgency mechanism

Examples:
- Price discount → Bonus stack instead
- "Free trial" → "Pay after results"
- 30-day guarantee → 90-day conditional guarantee
- "Limited spots" → "Price increases after [date]"

"Now we're changing HOW you incentivize action. What enhancement haven't you tried?"

### Level 6: Monetization Structure (Last Resort)

What to change:
- Pricing model
- Payment terms
- Core offer structure

Examples:
- One-time → Subscription
- Pay upfront → Payment plan
- Single product → Tiered offers
- Course → Membership → Coaching

"This is a significant change. Only do this if Levels 1-5 failed. What different model might work better?"

## Step 3: Refresh Plan

Based on diagnosis, create a testing sequence:

```
REFRESH PLAN FOR: [Offer Name]

FATIGUE TYPE: [A/B/C/D]

TESTING SEQUENCE:

TEST 1 (Level X):
- What to change: [Specific change]
- New version: [Description]
- Success metric: [What you'll measure]
- Test duration: [Timeframe]

TEST 2 (Level X - if Test 1 fails):
- What to change: [Specific change]
- New version: [Description]
- Success metric: [What you'll measure]

TEST 3 (Level X - if Test 2 fails):
- ...

ONLY IF TESTS 1-3 FAIL:
- Escalate to Level [X]
- Consider: [What would need to change]
```

## Step 4: Execute First Refresh

If they want to work on it now:

"Let's do [Level X] refresh right now. Current version: [What they have]. Let's create [number] alternatives."

Walk through creating 2-3 variations at that level.

For creative/copy refreshes: Generate new angles
For naming refreshes: Use M.A.G.I.C. formula
For enhancer refreshes: Reference appropriate enhancement file

</process>

<critical_rules>

**Never skip levels:** If they haven't tested new creative, don't let them blow up the offer structure.

**Protect what works:** Ask "What's definitely working that we should keep?" Preserve those elements.

**One variable at a time:** Don't change creative AND copy AND headline simultaneously. You won't know what worked.

**Give tests time:** Minimum 3-5 days, ideally 7-14 days per test. Don't panic-switch.

**When to give up:** If you've exhausted Levels 1-5 and nothing works, the offer may genuinely be done for this audience. Consider new market segment or new offer.

<success_criteria>

Refresh workflow is complete when:
- [ ] Fatigue type diagnosed
- [ ] Variation Hierarchy level identified
- [ ] Refresh plan created with testing sequence
- [ ] First variation(s) created
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] User knows when to escalate vs. when to declare victory

</success_criteria>
