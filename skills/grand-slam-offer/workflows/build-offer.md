<objective>

Execute the full offer creation process: turn problems into solutions, create delivery vehicles, add all five enhancements (scarcity, urgency, bonuses, guarantees, naming), and set premium pricing.

**Input:** Market, dream outcome, and problem list (from plan phase or shared by user)
**Output:** Complete Grand Slam Offer ready to sell

</objective>

<entry_validation>

**If user is entering with an existing plan or partial offer:**

Ask them to share:
1. Target market
2. Dream outcome
3. Problems they've identified (if any)
4. What they've already built (if anything)

**Before proceeding, validate against essential principles:**

| Check | Question | If Fails |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Market | Does it pass 4 criteria? | "Your market has a gap. [Specific issue]. Want to address this first or proceed with the risk acknowledged?" |
| Dream Outcome | Is it visceral and status-focused? | "This dream outcome is too vague. Let's sharpen it: What will people SAY about them when they achieve this?" |
| Problem Count | Are there 32+? | "You have [X] problems. That's below the target of 32. Either you need more customer research, or let's brainstorm more now." |

**Do not proceed without acknowledgment.** Either fix the gap or get explicit "proceed anyway" from user.

</entry_validation>

<process>

## Step 1: Convert Problems to Solutions

For each problem, create a "How to..." statement.

**Problem:** "I don't have time to cook healthy meals"
**Solution:** "How to eat healthy without cooking (even if you work 60+ hours/week)"

**Problem:** "I've tried this before and failed"
**Solution:** "How to succeed this time when everything else has failed"

Work through each problem:

"Let's turn each problem into a solution. For '[Problem]', the solution is..."

The solution should:
- Mirror the problem language
- Include a parenthetical that addresses the objection
- Sound like something they'd pay for

## Step 2: Create Delivery Vehicles (Delivery Cube)

For each solution, determine HOW to deliver it using 6 dimensions:

| Dimension | Options | High-Value Lean |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Personal Attention | 1-on-1 → Small Group → One-to-Many | One-to-Many |
| Effort Level | DFY → DWY → DIY | DIY (highest margin) |
| Live Medium | In-Person → Phone → Zoom → Chat → Email | Async preferred |
| Recorded Format | Video → Audio → Written | Written (fastest to create) |
| Response Speed | Instant → Hours → Days | Set expectations, deliver faster |
| 10x/÷10 Test | What if 10x price? What if 1/10? | Reveals true value |

**For each solution, ask:**

"For '[Solution]', what's the delivery vehicle?
- Who delivers it? (You, team, automated, peer community)
- What format? (Course, template, call, software, done-for-you)
- How much of YOUR time per customer?"

**Optimize for:**
- Low cost to you
- High perceived value to them
- Scalability

**High-leverage insight:** One-to-many, DIY solutions with recorded delivery = highest margin. Save 1-on-1 for premium tiers.

## Step 3: Trim and Stack

List all solutions with delivery vehicles. Evaluate each:

| Solution | Delivery | Your Cost | Their Value | Keep? |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [Solution 1] | [Vehicle] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | ? |

**Remove:**
- High cost + Low value (waste)
- Low cost + Low value (clutter)

**Keep:**
- Low cost + High value (profit engine)
- High cost + High value (premium tier only)

**Stack with dollar values:**

Assign a believable price to each component:

"If someone bought JUST this solution separately, what would it cost?"

| Component | Standalone Value |
|-----------|------------------|
| [Solution 1] | $X |
| [Solution 2] | $X |
| ... | ... |
| **Total Value** | **$X** |

**Target:** Total value = 5-10x your actual price

<book_example>
**From the book — Weight loss offer value stack:**

```
✓ Foolproof Bargain Grocery System ────────── $1,000 value
✓ "Ready in 5 min" Busy Parent Cooking Guide ── $600 value
✓ Personalized "Lick Your Fingers Good" Meal Plan ── $500 value
✓ Fat Burning Workouts (Better Than Alone) ──── $699 value
✓ "Never Fall Off" Accountability System ───── $1,000 value
✓ "Live It Up While Slimming Down" Eating Out ── $349 value
✓ "Tone Up While You Travel" Blueprint ─────── $199 value
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
TOTAL VALUE: $4,351 → PRICE: $599 (7.3x ratio)
```

Each component has a benefit-focused name and justified value.

## Step 4: Add Scarcity

Ask: "What's your real capacity limit? How many can you actually serve well?"

**Three scarcity types:**

1. **Limited supply of seats/slots**
   - "We only accept 5 new clients per month"
   - "This cohort is limited to 20 people"

2. **Limited supply of bonuses**
   - "First 10 get [bonus]"
   - "The 1-on-1 call is only available for next 5 signups"

3. **Never available again**
   - "This version is closing permanently"
   - "This pricing goes away forever on [date]"

**Critical:** Scarcity must be REAL. Ask: "Can you actually enforce this? Will you turn away money?"

If they can't commit to real scarcity, acknowledge what they're leaving on the table and move on.

## Step 5: Add Urgency

Ask: "What time limit makes sense for your business model?"

**Four urgency tactics:**

| Tactic | Best For | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Rolling Cohorts | Courses, programs | "Next cohort starts Monday" |
| Rolling Seasonal | Local businesses | "Summer Special ends Aug 31" |
| Pricing/Bonus-Based | Info products | "This bonus expires Friday" |
| Exploding Opportunity | High-ticket | "This slot goes to whoever acts first" |

**The 50-60% Rule:** Last 3% of campaign time = 50-60% of sales. Deadlines work.

**Critical:** Urgency must be REAL. Ask: "Will you actually remove this on the deadline?"

## Step 6: Add Bonuses

**The 10 Bonus Bullets:**

1. Always offer bonuses
2. Give each bonus a specific name with benefit in title
3. Explain: what it is, why it helps, how you discovered/created it
4. Provide proof it works
5. Paint vivid picture of life after using bonus
6. Assign specific dollar value with justification
7. Tools/checklists > trainings (higher perceived value)
8. Each bonus solves a specific obstacle from problem list
9. Include bonuses that solve their NEXT problem
10. Total bonus value should ECLIPSE core offer price

**Bonus brainstorm:**

"Looking at your problem list, which problems could be solved with:
- A template or checklist?
- A swipe file or example library?
- A calculator or assessment tool?
- Access to a resource/rolodex?
- A done-for-you component?"

**Partner bonuses:**

"Do you know anyone whose product/service would help your customers AND doesn't compete with you? They might give you their product as a bonus (for free) in exchange for exposure."

## Step 7: Add Guarantee

Ask: "What guarantee can you offer that reverses their risk?"

**Four guarantee types:**

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Unconditional | No questions asked refund | Low-ticket, confident delivery |
| Conditional | Refund if they do X, Y, Z and don't get result | Mid-ticket, requires effort |
| Anti-Guarantee | All sales final (with reason) | High-ticket, premium positioning |
| Performance/Implied | Pay only when results achieved | Service businesses, agencies |

**Guarantee math:**
- Without guarantee: 100 sales, 5% refunds = 95 net
- With strong guarantee: 130 sales, 10% refunds = 117 net
- **Result: 23% more sales even with doubled refunds**

**Stacking guarantees:**

"Can you offer more than one guarantee? Example:
- Unconditional 30-day money back
- PLUS conditional 'double your money back if you do X and don't get Y'"

**If they refuse a guarantee:**

"A guarantee typically increases conversions 2-4x. The math almost always works out. But if you're not confident in your delivery, that's a different problem to solve. Do you want to proceed without one, knowing you're leaving that conversion lift on the table?"

Acknowledge and move on if they insist.

## Step 8: Name with M.A.G.I.C.

**M.A.G.I.C. Formula:**

- **M** - Magnet/Reason Why (Free, 88% Off, Spring, Grand Opening)
- **A** - Avatar (Busy Moms, B2B Sales Reps, Gym Owners)
- **G** - Goal (Pain Free, Celebrity Smile, Double Your Profit)
- **I** - Interval (21-Day, 6-Week, 90-Day)
- **C** - Container (Challenge, Blueprint, Bootcamp, System)

**Examples:**
- "Free 6-Week Busy Mom Bikini Blueprint"
- "Grand Opening Special: 90-Day B2B Sales Accelerator System"

**Power moves:**
- Rhyme: "Six-Pack Fast Track"
- Alliterate: "Big Booty Bootcamp"

**Generate 3-5 name options**, then ask which resonates most.

## Step 9: Set Premium Price

**Price should be:**
- 1/5 to 1/10 of total value stack
- Higher than they're comfortable saying out loud (stretch)
- Defensible based on value delivered

**The Dan Kennedy rule:** "Charge as high a price as you can say out loud without cracking a smile."

**Test the price:**

"Say the price out loud. Does it feel right? If you're comfortable, it's probably too low. The price should make you slightly nervous."

## Step 10: Final Assembly

Present the complete offer:

```
GRAND SLAM OFFER: [NAME]

TARGET: [Avatar description]

DREAM OUTCOME: [Status-focused outcome]

THE OFFER:
[Main deliverable]

WHAT'S INCLUDED:
1. [Component 1] (Value: $X)
2. [Component 2] (Value: $X)
...

BONUSES:
1. [Bonus 1]: [Description] (Value: $X)
2. [Bonus 2]: [Description] (Value: $X)
...

TOTAL VALUE: $[sum]

GUARANTEE: [Guarantee statement]

SCARCITY: [Limit]

URGENCY: [Deadline]

PRICE: $[price]
(That's [X]% off the total value)
```

</process>

<critical_checkpoints>

Throughout, ask:

**After Step 3 (Trim & Stack):**
- "Looking at this stack, would YOU pay [target price] for this?"
- "What's missing that would make this a no-brainer?"

**After Step 7 (Guarantee):**
- "Does this guarantee make you nervous to offer? If not, it's probably too weak."

**After Step 9 (Price):**
- "Is this price high enough to attract your BEST customers and repel the complainers?"
