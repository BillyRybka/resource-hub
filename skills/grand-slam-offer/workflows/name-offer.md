</required_reading>

<objective>

Create a compelling offer name using the M.A.G.I.C. formula. Names can increase response rates 2-10x. This workflow produces 5-10 name options ranked by strength.

**Input:** Offer details (who it's for, what it delivers, any constraints)
**Output:** Ranked list of names with rationale for top choices

</objective>

<intake>

Ask: "Tell me about the offer you need to name:
1. Who is it for? (Be specific - not 'business owners' but 'B2B SaaS founders')
2. What's the main outcome/result they get?
3. How long does it take? (Any specific timeframe?)
4. What format is it? (Course, program, service, product, challenge?)
5. Any words/themes you want to include or avoid?"

**If renaming an existing offer:**
"What's the current name and why isn't it working?"

</intake>

<process>

## Step 1: M.A.G.I.C. Component Brainstorm

Work through each component:

### M - Magnet / Reason Why

What draws attention and justifies the offer existing NOW?

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Free/Discount | Free, 88% Off, Half Price |
| Seasonal | Spring, Summer, Holiday, New Year |
| Event | Grand Opening, Anniversary, Launch |
| Milestone | 100th Client, 10-Year, First Ever |
| Exclusive | VIP, Insider, Private, Members-Only |
| Limited | One-Time, Final, Last Chance |

"What's a compelling reason for this offer to exist right now?"

Generate 3-5 magnet options.

### A - Avatar

Who is this for, specifically?

**Niching directions:**
- Demographic: Busy Moms, Executive Women, Millennial Dads
- Professional: Sales Reps, Agency Owners, Gym Owners
- Psychographic: Ambitious Beginners, Burnt-Out Experts
- Situational: Career Changers, New Parents, First-Time Founders

**Power move:** Combine two identifiers:
- "Busy Professional Moms"
- "Tech-Savvy Boomer Investors"

"How would your ideal customer describe themselves in 2-4 words?"

Generate 3-5 avatar options.

### G - Goal

What outcome do they achieve?

**Frame as:**
- Positive gain: Celebrity Smile, Six-Figure, Lean & Strong
- Pain removed: Pain-Free, Stress-Free, Debt-Free
- Status achieved: Expert, Authority, Thought Leader
- Transformation: Bikini Body, Dream Job, Financial Freedom

**Power move:** Use specific numbers when possible:
- "Six-Figure" beats "High Income"
- "20lb" beats "Weight Loss"
- "Double Your" beats "Increase Your"

"What specific, visceral outcome do they want? What would they brag about?"

Generate 3-5 goal options.

### I - Interval

What timeframe creates urgency and believability?

| Interval | Vibe |
|----------|------|
| 7-Day | Quick win, intensive |
| 14-Day | Two-week sprint |
| 21-Day | Habit formation |
| 30-Day | Month commitment |
| 6-Week | Serious program |
| 90-Day | Quarterly transformation |
| 12-Week | Quarter-length |

**Considerations:**
- Shorter = more urgency, easier sell
- Longer = bigger outcome claims believable
- Match to actual delivery time

"What's the realistic timeframe? Can we make it shorter and more intensive?"

Generate 2-3 interval options.

### C - Container

What vessel holds the offer?

| Container | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| Challenge | Short-term, community, urgency |
| Blueprint | Step-by-step systems |
| Bootcamp | Intensive, fitness vibes |
| Accelerator | Speed, business growth |
| System | Comprehensive, methodical |
| Method | Proprietary approach |
| Formula | Specific recipe |
| Protocol | Scientific, health |
| Academy | Extensive training |
| Masterclass | Premium, expert-led |
| Workshop | Interactive, hands-on |
| Intensive | Focused, short-term |

"What container word matches the energy of your offer?"

Generate 3-5 container options.

## Step 2: Generate Combinations

Create 10+ name combinations using components:

**Formula patterns:**

Full M.A.G.I.C.:
"[Magnet] [Interval] [Avatar] [Goal] [Container]"
→ "Free 6-Week Busy Mom Bikini Blueprint"

M.A.G.C. (no interval):
"[Magnet] [Avatar] [Goal] [Container]"
→ "Exclusive Gym Owner Profit Accelerator"

A.G.I.C. (no magnet):
"[Avatar] [Goal] [Interval] [Container]"
→ "Agency Owner Six-Figure 90-Day System"

G.I.C. (simple):
"[Goal] [Interval] [Container]"
→ "Six-Figure 90-Day Accelerator"

**Power moves:**

Rhyme: "Six-Pack Fast Track" / "Wealth Health Method"
Alliteration: "Big Booty Bootcamp" / "Profit Protocol for Pros"
Number + Outcome: "7-Figure Funnel Formula" / "21-Day Detox Domination"

Generate at least 10 combinations.

## Step 3: Evaluate and Rank

Score each name on:

| Criterion | Weight | Question |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Clarity | High | Do you know what you're getting? |
| Specificity | High | Does it speak to a specific person? |
| Outcome | High | Is the result obvious? |
| Memorability | Medium | Will they remember it? |
| Pronounceability | Medium | Easy to say out loud? |
| Uniqueness | Medium | Does it stand out from competitors? |
| Credibility | Medium | Is it believable? |

**Red flags to eliminate:**
- Too long (more than 7 words)
- Generic (could apply to any competitor)
- Confusing (requires explanation)
- Cringe (trying too hard)
- Unpronounceable (awkward to say)

## Step 4: Present Top 5

```
TOP NAME RECOMMENDATIONS

#1: [Name]
Why: [Specific rationale - which components are strongest]
Vibe: [What it communicates]

#2: [Name]
Why: [Rationale]
Vibe: [What it communicates]

#3: [Name]
Why: [Rationale]
Vibe: [What it communicates]

#4: [Name]
Why: [Rationale]
Vibe: [What it communicates]

#5: [Name]
Why: [Rationale]
Vibe: [What it communicates]

ALSO CONSIDERED:
- [Name] - [Why not ranked higher]
- [Name] - [Why not ranked higher]
```

## Step 5: Refinement

Ask: "Which of these resonates most? Or what do you like from multiple options?"

If they want refinement:
- Combine elements they liked
- Generate 3-5 more variations on the preferred direction
- Test different container words with same components

## Step 6: Final Selection

Once they choose, validate:

**The 3-Second Test:**
"If someone saw this name for 3 seconds, would they know:
- Who it's for?
- What they get?
- Why they should care?"

**The Say-It-Out-Loud Test:**
"Say the name out loud 3 times. Does it feel natural? Would you be proud to say 'I run the [Name]'?"

**The Competitor Test:**
"Could a competitor use this exact name and it would make sense for them? If yes, it's too generic."
