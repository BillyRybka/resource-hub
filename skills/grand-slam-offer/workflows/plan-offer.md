# Workflow: Plan an Offer

<required_reading>

**Read these reference files NOW:**
1. references/market-selection.md
2. references/value-equation-deep-dive.md

</required_reading>

<objective>

Complete the strategy phase of offer creation: validate the market, define the dream outcome, and identify all problems to solve. This workflow produces the foundation that `build-offer.md` will execute on.

**Output:** A validated market, clear dream outcome, and comprehensive problem list ready for solution development.

## Working Document Setup

**At the start of planning:**

1. Ask the user: "What would you like to call this offer for now? (We can rename it later with M.A.G.I.C.)"
2. Create the working document from `templates/offer-working-doc.md`
3. Save as `{offer-name}-WORKING.md` in the user's preferred location (ask if unclear)
4. Replace `{{OFFER_NAME}}` with their answer and `{{DATE}}` with today's date

**After each major step:**
- Update the relevant section in the working document
- Mark the checkbox as complete in the Progress section
- Update the `updated:` date in the frontmatter

**This ensures work is never lost if the conversation ends.**

## Step 1: Market Validation

**Even if they think they know their market, validate it.**

Ask: "Who is your target customer? Be specific - not just 'small business owners' but 'B2B SaaS founders with 10-50 employees struggling to reduce churn.'"

Once they answer, evaluate against the **Four Market Criteria**:

| Criterion | Question to Ask | Red Flag |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Massive Pain | "On a scale of 1-10, how urgently do they NEED this solved?" | Below 7 |
| Purchasing Power | "What's the most they've paid for similar solutions?" | "They're price-sensitive" |
| Easy to Target | "Where do 10,000+ of them gather that you could reach affordably?" | Can't name specific places |
| Growing | "Is this market expanding, stable, or shrinking?" | Shrinking or highly competitive |

**If market fails criteria:**

Be direct: "This market has a problem. [Specific issue]. Here's why that matters: [consequence]. You have two options:
1. Niche down further (same product, narrower audience = higher prices)
2. Pivot to adjacent market that passes all four criteria

Which direction interests you?"

**Niching examples to share:**
- "Time Management" → $19
- "Time Management for Sales Professionals" → $99
- "Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps" → $499
- "Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools Sales Reps" → $2,000

**If market passes criteria:** Confirm and move to Step 2.

**SAVE POINT:** Update the Market section in the working document. Mark "Market validated" checkbox complete.

## Step 2: Define Dream Outcome

Ask: "What's the end result your customer desperately wants? Not what you sell - what they GET. The destination, not the plane flight."

**Push for specificity:**
- Bad: "They want to grow their business"
- Better: "They want to double revenue"
- Best: "They want to hit $100K/month so they can quit their job and have their spouse respect their decision to start a business"

**Frame in status terms:**

Ask: "When they achieve this outcome, what will others think or say about them? What status do they gain?"

Examples:
- Weight loss → "Wow, you look amazing! What's your secret?"
- Business growth → "I can't believe you built that. You're crushing it."
- Skill acquisition → "You're the expert everyone asks for advice."

**Test the dream outcome:**

Ask yourself (and them):
- "Would they feel embarrassed to admit how badly they want this?"
- "Would they pay almost anything to have this RIGHT NOW?"
- "Is this something they think about at 2am?"

If no to any → dig deeper. The dream outcome isn't visceral enough.

**SAVE POINT:** Update the Dream Outcome section in the working document. Mark "Dream outcome defined" checkbox complete.

## Step 3: Identify All Problems

**The process:**

1. List every ACTION they must take to achieve the dream outcome
2. For EACH action, identify problems in 4 categories:

| Value Driver | Question | Example (Weight Loss Dream) |
|--------------|----------|----------------------------|
| Dream Outcome | "Why won't this be financially worth it?" | "Healthy food is too expensive" |
| Perceived Likelihood of Achievement | "Why won't this work for me?" | "My metabolism is slow" / "I always fail diets" |
| Effort & Sacrifice | "Why is this too hard / what must I give up?" | "I don't know what to buy" / "I'll miss eating out" |
| Time Delay | "Why will this take too long?" | "I don't have time to cook" |

**Walk through it with them:**

"Let's map out everything someone needs to DO to achieve [dream outcome]. Then we'll find every reason they might fail or quit at each step."

Example for weight loss:
- Action: Start a diet → Problems: Don't know what diet, tried before and failed, don't know what to buy, hate cooking
- Action: Exercise regularly → Problems: No time, gym is intimidating, don't know what exercises, get bored
- Action: Stay consistent → Problems: Travel disrupts routine, social pressure, plateau frustration, motivation fades

**Keep pushing:**

"What else? What's something people are embarrassed to admit stops them? What would they never say out loud but secretly worry about?"

**List as many as you can.** The framework is just to get your brain going - if it's easier, just brainstorm freely without the buckets. Don't get overwhelmed. The more problems you identify, the more opportunities you have to create value. Each problem is a chance to differentiate your offer.

<book_example>
**From the book — "Buy Healthy Food" action with all 4 categories:**

| Value Driver | Problems Identified |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Dream Outcome | "Healthy food is expensive" / "This diet won't be worth the cost" |
| Perceived Likelihood of Achievement | "I don't know what's actually healthy" / "My family won't eat this" / "I'll mess it up" |
| Effort & Sacrifice | "Reading labels is confusing" / "Don't know how to find deals" / "I'll miss my comfort foods" |
| Time Delay | "Grocery shopping takes forever" / "Too busy for multiple stores" |

Repeat this for every action (cook, eat, exercise, stay accountable) → 40+ problems total.

**Full example:** `references/examples/weight-loss-offer.md`
</book_example>

**SAVE POINT:** Update the Problems section in the working document with all identified problems. Update the Problem Count subsection.

## Step 4: Validate Problem List

Review the problems against the Value Equation:

- **Dream Outcome problems:** "This won't be financially worth it"
- **Perceived Likelihood of Achievement problems:** "This won't work for ME specifically"
- **Effort & Sacrifice problems:** "This is too hard, confusing, or requires giving up too much"
- **Time Delay problems:** "This will take too long or isn't convenient"

Ask: "Which category has the MOST problems? That's where your offer needs to over-deliver."

**Create the problem inventory:**

Format each problem as a clear statement:
1. [Problem] - [Category]
2. [Problem] - [Category]
...

This becomes the input for the build phase.

**SAVE POINT:** Mark "Problems identified" checkbox complete. Update the Biggest Opportunity subsection.

## Step 5: Summarize the Plan

Present back:

```
OFFER PLAN SUMMARY

TARGET MARKET:
[Specific description]
- Massive Pain: [Score/Evidence]
- Purchasing Power: [Evidence]
- Targetability: [Where to find them]
- Growth: [Market direction]

DREAM OUTCOME:
[Visceral, status-focused statement]

PROBLEMS TO SOLVE (X total):

Dream Outcome Problems (X):
- [List]

Perceived Likelihood of Achievement Problems (X):
- [List]

Effort & Sacrifice Problems (X):
- [List]

Time Delay Problems (X):
- [List]

BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY:
[Which category is heaviest - that's where to focus delivery]

READY FOR BUILD PHASE: Yes/No
[If no, what's missing]
```

**FINAL SAVE:** Update the working document status from `planning` to `building` in the frontmatter. All Planning Phase checkboxes should now be complete. The document is ready for the build workflow.

</process>

<critical_questions>

Use these throughout to challenge weak thinking:

**Market challenges:**
- "If this market is so good, why isn't everyone serving them?"
- "What's the most someone in this market has paid for anything? Not your category - anything."
- "Can you name 5 specific people who fit this description right now?"

**Dream outcome challenges:**
- "Is that what they SAY they want or what they ACTUALLY want?"
- "Would they be embarrassed to admit how badly they want this?"
- "What's the status game underneath this goal?"

**Problem challenges:**
- "What problem are they lying about not having?"
- "What problem have they given up on solving?"
- "What problem do they not even know they have yet?"
