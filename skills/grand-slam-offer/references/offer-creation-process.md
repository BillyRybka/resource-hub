## Step 1: Identify Dream Outcome

> **Deep Dive:** See `dream-outcome.md` for the complete formula, real examples across 6+ industries, the Dream Outcome Builder template, and common mistakes to avoid.

### The Principle

You're not selling the plane flight—you're selling the vacation. Not the drill—the hole. Not the process—the transformation.

### Dream Outcome Criteria

**Must be:**
- Specific (measurable when possible)
- Visceral (they can FEEL wanting it)
- Status-enhancing (others will notice/comment)
- Time-bound (when will they arrive?)

### Examples by Industry

| Industry | Process (Don't Sell) | Dream Outcome (Sell This) |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Fitness | "6-week program" | "Lose 20lbs in 6 weeks" |
| Business | "Marketing services" | "Add $239,000/year in revenue" |
| Dating | "Coaching sessions" | "Find your soulmate in 90 days" |
| Career | "Resume writing" | "Land your dream job in 30 days" |
| Real Estate | "Listing services" | "Sell your home for top dollar in 21 days" |

### Status Frame

Frame outcomes in terms of what OTHERS will think/say:

**Weak:** "You'll lose 20 pounds"
**Strong:** "Your friends' jaws will drop when they see you at the reunion"

**Weak:** "Your business will grow"
**Strong:** "You'll be the one other business owners ask for advice"

### Dream Outcome Worksheet

```
1. What is the #1 result my customer wants?
   ________________________________________________

2. How would they describe success in their own words?
   ________________________________________________

3. What will others say/think when they achieve this?
   ________________________________________________

4. How quickly can they realistically get there?
   ________________________________________________

5. DREAM OUTCOME STATEMENT:
   "[Avatar] will [specific result] in [timeframe]"
   ________________________________________________
```

### Dream Outcome Formula

Use this template for crisp, compelling outcomes:

```
[X specific outcome] in [Y time period] without [biggest pain or fear]
```

**Full Avatar Version:**
```
I help [avatar] achieve [specific outcome] in [time period] without [biggest pain/fear]
```

**Examples:**

| Business | Formula Applied |
|----------|-----------------|
| Weight Loss | "Lose 20 pounds in six weeks without giving up the foods you love" |
| Weight Loss (w/ Avatar) | "I help moms with 3+ kids lose weight in 6 months without going to the gym or changing what the family eats" |
| B2B | "Add $100k in annual revenue in 90 days without hiring more staff" |
| Real Estate Investing | "Close your first deal in 60 days without risking your savings" |

**The "Without" Options:**
- Without biggest pain
- Without biggest fear
- Without biggest sacrifice
- Without extra time/trips/effort

---

## Step 2: List All Problems

### The Principle

Every obstacle between your prospect and their dream outcome is an opportunity to create value. More problems identified = more value created = higher prices justified.

### The Four Problem Categories (Value Equation Aligned)

For EACH action they must take, apply these four lenses:

| Value Driver | Their Appraisal | What They're Thinking |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Dream Outcome** | "Not worth it" | "This will not be financially worth it" |
| **Perceived Likelihood of Achievement** | "Won't work for me" | "It won't work for me specifically. I won't be able to stick with it. External factors will get in my way." |
| **Effort & Sacrifice** | "Too hard" | "This will be too hard, confusing. I won't like it. I will suck at it." |
| **Time Delay** | "Takes too long" | "This will take too much time to do. I am too busy. It will take too long to work. It won't be convenient for me." |

**Note on Objections:** Objections about buying or using your solution ("What if it doesn't work for me?" / "I don't have time to learn this" / "My situation is different") are Perceived Likelihood and Effort & Sacrifice problems. Treat them like any other problem—they need to be solved somewhere in your offer.

**For each category, ask:**
- "Not worth it" → How can I make this MORE financially worth it?
- "Won't work for me" → How can I prove this WILL work for them specifically?
- "Too hard" → How can I make it easy? Simple? Enjoyable?
- "Takes too long" → How can I make it faster? More convenient?

### The "Next Need" Hack (Before/During/After)

Problems exist at every stage of the customer journey. Don't just solve problems DURING—solve them BEFORE they start and AFTER they finish:

| Phase | What to Ask | Example Problems |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **BEFORE** (they haven't started) | "What stops them from beginning?" | Setup, preparation, clearing schedule, getting buy-in |
| **DURING** (they're in the program) | "What stops them from completing?" | Confusion, motivation, competing priorities, setbacks |
| **AFTER** (the program ends) | "What stops them from maintaining?" | Backsliding, new situations, social pressure, travel |

**Why this matters:**
- BEFORE problems = reasons they don't START (lost sales)
- DURING problems = reasons they don't COMPLETE (poor results)
- AFTER problems = reasons they don't MAINTAIN (no referrals)

### Process: Action Mapping

**Step 2a:** List every action required to achieve the dream outcome
**Step 2b:** Apply 4 categories to each action
**Step 2c:** List specific problems under each category

### Complete Example: Weight Loss

**Dream Outcome:** Lose 20lbs in 6 weeks

**Action 1: Buy healthy food**

| Value Driver | Problems |
|--------------|----------|
| Dream Outcome | "Healthy food is expensive" / "This diet won't be worth the cost" |
| Perceived Likelihood of Achievement | "I don't know what's actually healthy" / "My family won't eat this" / "I'll mess it up" |
| Effort & Sacrifice | "Reading labels is confusing" / "I don't know how to find deals" / "I'll miss my comfort foods" |
| Time Delay | "Grocery shopping takes forever" / "I'm too busy to go to multiple stores" |

**Action 2: Cook healthy food**

| Value Driver | Problems |
|--------------|----------|
| Dream Outcome | "Cooking at home costs more than I thought" / "Not worth the hassle financially" |
| Perceived Likelihood of Achievement | "I'm a terrible cook" / "My meals never taste good" / "I'll get bored of bland food" |
| Effort & Sacrifice | "Recipes are complicated" / "I don't know kitchen basics" / "I have to give up eating out" |
| Time Delay | "Cooking takes too long" / "I don't have time for meal prep" |

**Action 3: Eat healthy food consistently**

| Value Driver | Problems |
|--------------|----------|
| Dream Outcome | "The results won't be worth what I'm giving up" |
| Perceived Likelihood of Achievement | "I always fall off diets" / "I have no willpower" / "Social events derail me" |
| Effort & Sacrifice | "Tracking calories is tedious" / "Portions are confusing" / "I'll miss happy hour" / "Can't enjoy holidays" |
| Time Delay | "Eating healthy takes too long" / "I can't meal prep every week" |

**Action 4: Exercise regularly**

| Value Driver | Problems |
|--------------|----------|
| Dream Outcome | "Gym membership isn't worth it" / "Equipment costs too much" |
| Perceived Likelihood of Achievement | "I hate the gym" / "I don't know proper form" / "I'll hurt myself" |
| Effort & Sacrifice | "Workouts are confusing" / "I don't know what to do" / "I'll be sore" / "I'll miss my TV time" |
| Time Delay | "I don't have an hour daily" / "Commute to gym is too long" |

**Action 5: Stay accountable**

| Value Driver | Problems |
|--------------|----------|
| Dream Outcome | "Coaching/accountability isn't worth the investment" |
| Perceived Likelihood of Achievement | "I'll quit like always" / "No one will check on me" |
| Effort & Sacrifice | "Staying motivated is hard" / "I need constant reminders" / "I'll have to admit when I fail" |
| Time Delay | "Tracking progress takes time" / "Weigh-ins are inconvenient" |

**Total problems identified:** 40+ (each one is an opportunity to create value)

## Step 3: Turn Problems Into Solutions

### The Principle

Every problem statement converts directly into a solution statement. This is copywriting 101—address their exact fear with your exact solution.

### Conversion Formula

**Problem:** [Negative statement about obstacle]
**Solution:** "How to [reverse the negative] (even if [their excuse])"

### Conversion Examples

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "I don't know what's actually healthy" | "How to know exactly what to buy (no nutrition degree required)" |
| "Grocery shopping takes forever" | "How to complete healthy shopping in under 20 minutes" |
| "I'm a terrible cook" | "How anyone can make delicious meals (even if you burn toast)" |
| "Cooking takes too long" | "How to cook healthy meals in under 5 minutes" |
| "I always fall off diets" | "How to stay consistent (even when life gets crazy)" |
| "I hate the gym" | "How to get better results than gym-goers without a gym" |
| "I'll miss happy hour" | "How to socialize without derailing your progress" |

### Solution Naming

Each solution should become a named component of your offer:

**Solution:** "How to complete healthy shopping in under 20 minutes"
**Named Component:** "The 20-Minute Grocery Blitz System"

**Solution:** "How to cook healthy meals in under 5 minutes"
**Named Component:** "Ready in 5 Busy Parent Cooking Guide"

## Step 4: Create Delivery Vehicles (The Delivery Cube)

### The Principle

For each solution, determine HOW you'll deliver it. The delivery method dramatically impacts both value perception and your costs.

### The Delivery Cube: 6 Dimensions

#### Dimension 1: Personal Attention Level

| Level | Description | Value | Cost |
|-------|-------------|-------|------|
| **1-on-1** | Individual attention | Highest | Highest |
| **Small Group** | 5-20 people | High | Medium |
| **One-to-Many** | Unlimited scale | Medium | Lowest |

#### Dimension 2: Effort Level (Who Does the Work)

| Level | Description | Value | Cost |
|-------|-------------|-------|------|
| **DFY** | Done-For-You | Highest | Highest |
| **DWY** | Done-With-You | High | Medium |
| **DIY** | Do-It-Yourself | Medium | Lowest |

#### Dimension 3: Live Support Medium

| Medium | Response Quality | Cost |
|--------|-----------------|------|
| **In-Person** | Highest | Highest |
| **Video Call** | High | Medium |
| **Phone** | Medium-High | Medium |
| **Chat/Text** | Medium | Low |
| **Email** | Lower | Lowest |

#### Dimension 4: Recorded Content Format

| Format | Engagement | Production Cost |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Video** | Highest | Highest |
| **Audio** | Medium | Low |
| **Written** | Varies | Lowest |

#### Dimension 5: Response Speed

| Speed | Perceived Value | Operational Cost |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **Instant** | Highest | Highest |
| **Same Day** | High | Medium |
| **24-48 Hours** | Medium | Low |
| **Async** | Lower | Lowest |

#### Dimension 6: The 10x / ÷10 Test

**10x Question:** "If they paid me 10x ($50,000 instead of $5,000), what would I deliver?"
→ Reveals your "premium tier" delivery

**÷10 Question:** "If they paid 1/10th ($500 instead of $5,000), how could I still get them results?"
→ Reveals your scalable, high-margin delivery

### Delivery Vehicle Examples

**Problem:** "I don't know what to buy at the grocery store"

| Delivery Vehicle | Attention | Effort | Medium | Format | Speed | Cost |
|------------------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|------|
| Personal shopping trip | 1-on-1 | DFY | In-person | Live | Instant | $$$$$ |
| Grocery list + video call | 1-on-1 | DWY | Video | Live | Same day | $$$ |
| Small group grocery tour | Small group | DWY | In-person | Live | Weekly | $$ |
| Recorded grocery tour video | One-to-many | DIY | Async | Video | Anytime | $ |
| Pre-made Instacart lists | One-to-many | DFY | Async | Written | Instant | $ |
| PDF grocery guide | One-to-many | DIY | Async | Written | Anytime | ¢ |

**The Magic:** The pre-made Instacart lists and PDF guide cost almost nothing to deliver but solve the problem just as effectively for most people.

### High-Margin Delivery Patterns

**Create once, deliver infinitely:**
- Recorded video trainings
- PDF guides and checklists
- Spreadsheet calculators
- Email sequences
- Template libraries
- Pre-built funnels/systems

**High value, low ongoing effort:**
- Group calls (1 hour serves 50+ people)
- Community access (members help each other)
- Office hours (batched Q&A)
- Automated assessments

---

## Step 5: Trim & Stack

### The Principle

Not everything you CAN deliver SHOULD be delivered. Remove low-value items, keep high-value items, and stack them for maximum perceived value.

### The Trim Matrix

| | Low Cost | High Cost |
|---|----------|-----------|
| **High Value** | ✅ KEEP (profit engine) | ✅ KEEP (premium only) |
| **Low Value** | ❌ REMOVE (clutter) | ❌ REMOVE (profit killer) |

### The 80% Gross Margin Rule (Service Businesses)

For service businesses, target 80%+ gross margins. If you charge $100, fulfillment should cost $20 or less.

**Why 80%?**

| Category | Approximate % |
|----------|---------------|
| Cost of Fulfillment | ~20% |
| Cost of Acquisition (marketing, sales, commissions) | ~20-30% |
| Infrastructure (software, admin, billing) | ~15-20% |
| **Net Profit** | **~30%+** |

You should be most profitable in the beginning—margins only decrease as you add infrastructure and team.

### Evaluation Criteria

For each delivery vehicle, ask:

1. **Dream Outcome:** Does this directly advance their result?
2. **Perceived Likelihood of Achievement:** Does this increase their belief it will work for THEM?
3. **Time Delay:** Does this speed up their results?
4. **Effort & Sacrifice:** Does this make their life easier?

If the answer isn't a clear "yes" to at least one, remove it.

### Trim Criteria Refined

**Limit high-cost items:** Keep 1-2 high-cost delivery items MAX per problem area. Fill the rest with high-value, low-cost items.

**The "One Fell Swoop" test:** Some delivery methods solve multiple problems at once. A personal grocery tour solves "confusing," "takes too long," AND "won't like it" simultaneously. Prioritize these multi-problem solvers.

**The balance:**
- Low-cost items handle the HOW (recordings, tools, templates, guides)
- High-cost items handle the FEAR (personal review, sign-off, done-for-you elements)

### Stacking Process

#### Step 5a: List all delivery vehicles you're keeping

#### Step 5b: Name each one using benefit-focused language

**Weak:** "Video training module"
**Strong:** "The 20-Minute Grocery Blitz System ($500 value)"

#### Step 5c: Assign dollar values with justification

**Justification types:**
- Time saved: "Saves you 10 hours/month = $500/month value"
- Money saved: "Saves $200/month on groceries = $2,400/year value"
- Results accelerated: "Gets you results 3 weeks faster = $1,000 value"
- Alternative cost: "Personal nutritionist costs $300/hour × 10 hours = $3,000 value"

#### Step 5d: Stack in order of impact

**Structure:**
```

## The Sales-Fulfillment Continuum

### The Principle

There's always a tradeoff between ease of selling and ease of fulfillment.

```
Easy to Sell ◄──────────────────────► Easy to Fulfill
(Do everything)                       (Do nothing)
```

### Strategy by Stage

**Starting out:** Over-deliver like crazy. Do more than you'll eventually do.
- Build case studies
- Learn what actually works
- Generate word-of-mouth

**Scaling:** Optimize for efficiency without sacrificing results.
- Systematize what works
- Create one-to-many solutions
- Reduce high-cost delivery

### Hormozi's Evolution

**Phase 1:** Flew to gyms, lived there 21 days, did everything personally
**Phase 2:** Taught gym owners to do it themselves remotely
**Result:** Same promise, 1/3 the effort, 100x the scale

### The Mantra

> "Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction."

1. Generate demand first (prove people want it)
2. Get them to say yes (over-deliver if needed)
3. Optimize operations (only after cash flows)

---

## The Tesla Pyramid: Build Top-Down

Build your business from the TOP down, not bottom up.

**The Tesla example:** They started with the $250k Roadster (few customers, highest price), then the $100k Model S/X, then finally the $30k Model 3/Y for mass market. They didn't start cheap and try to work up—they started premium and expanded down.

**Why top-down works:**
- **Cash flow first** — High ticket + fewer clients = faster profitability
- **Price anchoring** — Your mid-tier feels cheap compared to your top-tier
- **Proof flows downward** — Results from high-touch validate lower-touch offers
- **No premature scaling** — Don't solve problems you don't have yet

**Applied to services:** Start with custom 1-on-1 / Done-For-You (learn, get testimonials, refine). Then create group / Done-With-You (scale proof, build systems). Finally, course / DIY (leverage, reach more people).

**The mistake:** "I need to be scalable first." You don't need scalability—you need clients. Get clients, then figure out scale.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't think of enough problems"

- Interview 10 customers/prospects
- Read Amazon reviews of competing products
- Search forums/Reddit for complaints
- Ask: "What did you try before that didn't work?"

### "My solutions seem generic"

- Add specificity: "5-minute" instead of "quick"
- Add proof: "used by 10,000+ customers"
- Add mechanism: "using the XYZ method"
- Add avatar: "even if you're a busy mom"

### "I can't justify high values"

- Calculate time saved × hourly rate
- Calculate money saved over time
- Compare to alternative solutions
- Factor in cost of NOT solving

### "My offer seems too complicated"

- Group related items into bundles
- Name bundles, not individual items
- Focus on 3-5 major components
- Move details to supporting materials
