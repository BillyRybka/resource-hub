## Step 1: Identify Dream Outcome

### The Principle

You're not selling the plane flight—you're selling the vacation. Not the drill—the hole. Not the process—the transformation.

### Dream Outcome Criteria

**Must be:**
- Specific (measurable when possible)
- Visceral (they can FEEL wanting it)
- Status-enhancing (others will notice/comment)
- Time-bound (when will they arrive?)

### Examples by Industry

| Industry | Process (Don't Sell) | Dream Outcome (Sell This) |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Fitness | "6-week program" | "Lose 20lbs in 6 weeks" |
| Business | "Marketing services" | "Add $239,000/year in revenue" |
| Dating | "Coaching sessions" | "Find your soulmate in 90 days" |
| Career | "Resume writing" | "Land your dream job in 30 days" |
| Real Estate | "Listing services" | "Sell your home for top dollar in 21 days" |

### Status Frame

Frame outcomes in terms of what OTHERS will think/say:

**Weak:** "You'll lose 20 pounds"
**Strong:** "Your friends' jaws will drop when they see you at the reunion"

**Weak:** "Your business will grow"
**Strong:** "You'll be the one other business owners ask for advice"

### Dream Outcome Worksheet

```
1. What is the #1 result my customer wants?
   ________________________________________________

2. How would they describe success in their own words?
   ________________________________________________

3. What will others say/think when they achieve this?
   ________________________________________________

4. How quickly can they realistically get there?
   ________________________________________________

5. DREAM OUTCOME STATEMENT:
   "[Avatar] will [specific result] in [timeframe]"
   ________________________________________________
```

## Step 2: List All Problems (Target: 32-64)

### The Principle

Every obstacle between your prospect and their dream outcome is an opportunity to create value. More problems identified = more value created = higher prices justified.

### The Four Problem Categories

For EACH action they must take, apply these four lenses:

| Category | Core Fear | Example Questions |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Likelihood** | "It won't work for me" | What's unique about their situation? Past failures? |
| **Time** | "It takes too long" | Why do they feel they don't have time? |
| **Effort** | "It's too hard" | What seems confusing/complicated/difficult? |
| **Sacrifice** | "The cost is too high" | What must they give up? (money, comfort, habits) |

### Process: Action Mapping

**Step 2a:** List every action required to achieve the dream outcome
**Step 2b:** Apply 4 categories to each action
**Step 2c:** List specific problems under each category

### Complete Example: Weight Loss

## Step 3: Turn Problems Into Solutions

### The Principle

Every problem statement converts directly into a solution statement. This is copywriting 101—address their exact fear with your exact solution.

### Conversion Formula

**Problem:** [Negative statement about obstacle]
**Solution:** "How to [reverse the negative] (even if [their excuse])"

### Conversion Examples

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "I don't know what's actually healthy" | "How to know exactly what to buy (no nutrition degree required)" |
| "Grocery shopping takes forever" | "How to complete healthy shopping in under 20 minutes" |
| "I'm a terrible cook" | "How anyone can make delicious meals (even if you burn toast)" |
| "Cooking takes too long" | "How to cook healthy meals in under 5 minutes" |
| "I always fall off diets" | "How to stay consistent (even when life gets crazy)" |
| "I hate the gym" | "How to get better results than gym-goers without a gym" |
| "I'll miss happy hour" | "How to socialize without derailing your progress" |

### Solution Naming

Each solution should become a named component of your offer:

**Solution:** "How to complete healthy shopping in under 20 minutes"
**Named Component:** "The 20-Minute Grocery Blitz System"

**Solution:** "How to cook healthy meals in under 5 minutes"
**Named Component:** "Ready in 5 Busy Parent Cooking Guide"

## Step 4: Create Delivery Vehicles (The Delivery Cube)

### The Principle

For each solution, determine HOW you'll deliver it. The delivery method dramatically impacts both value perception and your costs.

### The Delivery Cube: 6 Dimensions

#### Dimension 1: Personal Attention Level

| Level | Description | Value | Cost |
|-------|-------------|-------|------|
| **1-on-1** | Individual attention | Highest | Highest |
| **Small Group** | 5-20 people | High | Medium |
| **One-to-Many** | Unlimited scale | Medium | Lowest |

#### Dimension 2: Effort Level (Who Does the Work)

| Level | Description | Value | Cost |
|-------|-------------|-------|------|
| **DFY** | Done-For-You | Highest | Highest |
| **DWY** | Done-With-You | High | Medium |
| **DIY** | Do-It-Yourself | Medium | Lowest |

#### Dimension 3: Live Support Medium

| Medium | Response Quality | Cost |
|--------|-----------------|------|
| **In-Person** | Highest | Highest |
| **Video Call** | High | Medium |
| **Phone** | Medium-High | Medium |
| **Chat/Text** | Medium | Low |
| **Email** | Lower | Lowest |

#### Dimension 4: Recorded Content Format

| Format | Engagement | Production Cost |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Video** | Highest | Highest |
| **Audio** | Medium | Low |
| **Written** | Varies | Lowest |

#### Dimension 5: Response Speed

| Speed | Perceived Value | Operational Cost |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **Instant** | Highest | Highest |
| **Same Day** | High | Medium |
| **24-48 Hours** | Medium | Low |
| **Async** | Lower | Lowest |

#### Dimension 6: The 10x / ÷10 Test

**10x Question:** "If they paid me 10x ($50,000 instead of $5,000), what would I deliver?"
→ Reveals your "premium tier" delivery

**÷10 Question:** "If they paid 1/10th ($500 instead of $5,000), how could I still get them results?"
→ Reveals your scalable, high-margin delivery

### Delivery Vehicle Examples

**Problem:** "I don't know what to buy at the grocery store"

| Delivery Vehicle | Attention | Effort | Medium | Format | Speed | Cost |
|------------------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|------|
| Personal shopping trip | 1-on-1 | DFY | In-person | Live | Instant | $$$$$ |
| Grocery list + video call | 1-on-1 | DWY | Video | Live | Same day | $$$ |
| Small group grocery tour | Small group | DWY | In-person | Live | Weekly | $$ |
| Recorded grocery tour video | One-to-many | DIY | Async | Video | Anytime | $ |
| Pre-made Instacart lists | One-to-many | DFY | Async | Written | Instant | $ |
| PDF grocery guide | One-to-many | DIY | Async | Written | Anytime | ¢ |

**The Magic:** The pre-made Instacart lists and PDF guide cost almost nothing to deliver but solve the problem just as effectively for most people.

### High-Margin Delivery Patterns

**Create once, deliver infinitely:**
- Recorded video trainings
- PDF guides and checklists
- Spreadsheet calculators
- Email sequences
- Template libraries
- Pre-built funnels/systems

**High value, low ongoing effort:**
- Group calls (1 hour serves 50+ people)
- Community access (members help each other)
- Office hours (batched Q&A)
- Automated assessments

---

## Step 5: Trim & Stack

### The Principle

Not everything you CAN deliver SHOULD be delivered. Remove low-value items, keep high-value items, and stack them for maximum perceived value.

### The Trim Matrix

| | Low Cost | High Cost |
|---|----------|-----------|
| **High Value** | ✅ KEEP (profit engine) | ✅ KEEP (premium only) |
| **Low Value** | ❌ REMOVE (clutter) | ❌ REMOVE (profit killer) |

### Evaluation Criteria

For each delivery vehicle, ask:

1. **Dream Outcome:** Does this directly advance their result?
2. **Likelihood:** Does this increase their belief it will work?
3. **Time:** Does this speed up their results?
4. **Effort:** Does this make their life easier?

If the answer isn't a clear "yes" to at least one, remove it.

### Stacking Process

#### Step 5a: List all delivery vehicles you're keeping

#### Step 5b: Name each one using benefit-focused language

**Weak:** "Video training module"
**Strong:** "The 20-Minute Grocery Blitz System ($500 value)"

#### Step 5c: Assign dollar values with justification

**Justification types:**
- Time saved: "Saves you 10 hours/month = $500/month value"
- Money saved: "Saves $200/month on groceries = $2,400/year value"
- Results accelerated: "Gets you results 3 weeks faster = $1,000 value"
- Alternative cost: "Personal nutritionist costs $300/hour × 10 hours = $3,000 value"

#### Step 5d: Stack in order of impact

**Structure:**
```

## The Sales-Fulfillment Continuum

### The Principle

There's always a tradeoff between ease of selling and ease of fulfillment.

```
Easy to Sell ◄──────────────────────► Easy to Fulfill
(Do everything)                       (Do nothing)
```

### Strategy by Stage

**Starting out:** Over-deliver like crazy. Do more than you'll eventually do.
- Build case studies
- Learn what actually works
- Generate word-of-mouth

**Scaling:** Optimize for efficiency without sacrificing results.
- Systematize what works
- Create one-to-many solutions
- Reduce high-cost delivery

### Hormozi's Evolution

**Phase 1:** Flew to gyms, lived there 21 days, did everything personally
**Phase 2:** Taught gym owners to do it themselves remotely
**Result:** Same promise, 1/3 the effort, 100x the scale

### The Mantra

> "Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction."

1. Generate demand first (prove people want it)
2. Get them to say yes (over-deliver if needed)
3. Optimize operations (only after cash flows)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't think of enough problems"

- Interview 10 customers/prospects
- Read Amazon reviews of competing products
- Search forums/Reddit for complaints
- Ask: "What did you try before that didn't work?"

### "My solutions seem generic"

- Add specificity: "5-minute" instead of "quick"
- Add proof: "used by 10,000+ customers"
- Add mechanism: "using the XYZ method"
- Add avatar: "even if you're a busy mom"

### "I can't justify high values"

- Calculate time saved × hourly rate
- Calculate money saved over time
- Compare to alternative solutions
- Factor in cost of NOT solving

### "My offer seems too complicated"

- Group related items into bundles
- Name bundles, not individual items
- Focus on 3-5 major components
- Move details to supporting materials
