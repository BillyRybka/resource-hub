# Variation Hierarchy - Refreshing Fatigued Offers

When offers stop converting, most people change the wrong things. Here's the correct order.

---

## The Core Principle

> "We are not changing the actual offer. We are only changing the wrapping paper."

**Your core offer:**
- The transformation you deliver
- Your price structure
- Your guarantee
- Your delivery mechanism

**The wrapper:**
- Images and videos
- Ad copy
- Headlines and names
- Promotion timing

**Change the wrapper before touching the core.**

## Why Offers Fatigue

### The Exposure Math

In a local market:
- Cost to reach 1,000 people: ~$20
- If 200,000 people in your area
- $10,000 reaches everyone once

**Result:** Small markets see your ads quickly. Fatigue happens faster.

### What "Fatigue" Actually Means

**Not fatigued:**
- People haven't seen your ad enough (need more frequency)
- Creative is stale but offer is fine
- Seasonality affecting response

**Actually fatigued:**
- Same people have seen it 10+ times
- Response rate declining despite fresh creative
- Diminishing returns despite optimizations

**Important:** Most "fatigue" is actually just bad creative or insufficient frequency.

## The Variation Hierarchy

**Change things in this order. Stop when performance recovers.**

### Level 1: Creative (Images/Videos)

**What to change:** The visual assets in your ads

**Why first:** 
- Lowest effort
- Fastest to test
- Usually the actual problem

**Options:**
- New images (different angles, contexts, people)
- New video (different hook, style, testimonial)
- New format (static → video, video → carousel)
- New style (professional → raw, raw → polished)

**How often:** Every 2-4 weeks, or when CTR drops 20%+

### Level 2: Body Copy

**What to change:** The words in your ad (not the headline)

**Why second:**
- Same offer, different angle
- Tests different pain points
- Moderate effort

**Options:**
- Lead with different pain point
- Lead with different outcome
- Different social proof
- Different story/hook
- Different emotional trigger

**How often:** After exhausting 3-5 creative variations

### Level 3: Headline / Name (M.A.G.I.C. Wrapper)

**What to change:** The offer name itself

**Examples:**
- "6-Week Lean Challenge" → "6-Week Tone Challenge"
- "Holiday Hangover" → "New Year New You"
- "Summer Shred" → "Beach Body Blueprint"

**Why third:**
- Changes perception without changing offer
- Requires new creative to match
- Creates "new" offer feeling

**Using M.A.G.I.C.:**
- Swap the Goal: "Lean" → "Toned" → "Sculpted"
- Swap the Container: "Challenge" → "Blueprint" → "Bootcamp"
- Swap the Reason Why: "Free" → "88% Off" → "Grand Opening"

**How often:** Quarterly, or when Levels 1-2 exhausted

### Level 4: Duration

**What to change:** The time period of your offer

**Examples:**
- 6 weeks → 8 weeks
- 21 days → 30 days
- 90 days → 12 weeks

**Why fourth:**
- Slight operational adjustment
- Creates new offer perception
- May affect pricing

**How often:** After exhausting Levels 1-3

### Level 5: Enhancer (Free/Discount Component)

**What to change:** The promotional hook

**Examples:**
- Free → $1 trial
- $1 trial → 88% off
- 88% off → Free bonus added
- Free bonus → Early bird pricing

**Why fifth:**
- Affects margin and expectations
- Changes who responds
- More significant operational impact

**How often:** 1-2x per year maximum

### Level 6: Monetization Structure

**What to change:** Pricing, payment terms, offer structure

**Examples:**
- One-time payment → Payment plan
- Retainer → Performance-based
- Monthly → Annual
- Single tier → Multiple tiers

**Why last:**
- Highest operational impact
- Most significant business change
- Affects everything downstream

**How often:** Only when business model needs evolution

## Local Business Special Considerations

### Why Local Fatigues Faster

> "In local markets, it's easier to get to work, but harder to keep working or scale."

**The math:**
- Limited addressable market
- Lower cost to reach everyone
- Faster saturation

### Local Refresh Strategy

**More frequent wrapper changes:**
- Creative: Every 2 weeks
- Copy: Monthly
- Name: Bi-monthly
- Always tie to local events, seasons, holidays

**Local-specific wrappers:**
- Town/neighborhood names in headline
- Local events as reason why
- Community-specific pain points
- Local social proof

## How to Know What to Change

### Decision Tree

```
Is CTR declining?
├── Yes → Change Creative (Level 1)
│   └── Still declining after 3 variations?
│       ├── Yes → Change Copy (Level 2)
│       └── No → Keep testing creative
│
└── No → Is conversion declining?
    ├── Yes → Check offer-market fit
    │   └── Market still valid?
    │       ├── Yes → Change Name (Level 3)
    │       └── No → Consider new market
    │
    └── No → Keep running, you're fine
```

### Warning Signs by Level

| Level | Warning Sign |
|-------|--------------|
| Creative | CTR dropping, same copy works elsewhere |
| Copy | CTR okay, but engagement/comments low |
| Name | All creative/copy variations underperforming |
| Duration | Feedback that timeline doesn't fit |
| Enhancer | Price objections despite interest |
| Structure | Fundamental business model issues |

## Testing Variations

### Process

1. **Identify** which level needs changing
2. **Create** 3-5 variations
3. **Test** with equal budget/exposure
4. **Measure** primary metric (CTR, conversion, revenue)
5. **Declare** winner after statistical significance
6. **Scale** winner, archive losers
7. **Repeat** when performance drops

### Sample Creative Test

**Control:** Current winning video
**Test A:** Same script, different person
**Test B:** Different hook, same content
**Test C:** Testimonial format
**Test D:** Behind-the-scenes style

Run each with 1,000 impressions. Best CTR wins.

### Sample Name Test

**Control:** "6-Week Lean Challenge"
**Test A:** "42-Day Transformation System"
**Test B:** "Busy Mom Body Blueprint"
**Test C:** "Summer Shred Bootcamp"

Run as separate campaigns. Compare all metrics.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Changing Too Much Too Fast

**Problem:** Change creative, copy, AND name at once
**Result:** Don't know what worked

**Fix:** One level at a time. Isolate variables.

### Mistake 2: Changing Core Too Soon

**Problem:** "Offers not converting → let's change the price/structure"
**Result:** Wasted effort, lost learnings, operational chaos

**Fix:** Exhaust Levels 1-3 before touching 4-6.

### Mistake 3: Not Tracking What Changed

**Problem:** "We tried a bunch of stuff, something worked"
**Result:** Can't replicate success

**Fix:** Document every change. Track results against specific variations.

### Mistake 4: Declaring Fatigue Too Early

**Problem:** Performance dips for a week → "The offer is dead"
**Result:** Abandon what could have worked

**Fix:** Statistical significance before decisions. Natural fluctuations happen.

## The Archive Vault

**Save everything:**
- Winning creatives (for inspiration)
- Losing creatives (to avoid repeating)
- Copy variations (for future angles)
- Past names (for rotation)
- Performance data (for pattern recognition)

**Review quarterly:**
- What worked best?
- What patterns emerge?
- What can be recycled with fresh creative?

## Summary

**When offers fatigue, change in this order:**

1. **Creative** — Images, videos, format (every 2-4 weeks)
2. **Copy** — Ad body text, angles (monthly)
3. **Name** — M.A.G.I.C. wrapper (quarterly)
4. **Duration** — Time period (rare)
5. **Enhancer** — Promotional hook (1-2x/year)
6. **Structure** — Business model (last resort)

**Key principles:**
- Wrapper before core
- One level at a time
- Test with statistical rigor
- Document everything
- Same offer, fresh perception

> "Once you've monetized an offer, rarely should you change it. Just rinse and repeat. Use your entrepreneurial ADD on the wrapper, not the machine."
