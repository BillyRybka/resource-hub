# Scarcity - Supply Psychology

Scarcity is one of the most powerful and least understood forces for unlocking premium pricing.

## The Core Principle

> "People want what they can't have. People want what other people want. People want things only a select few have access to."

**Fear of loss is stronger than desire for gain.**

When supply is limited, demand increases. When demand exceeds supply, prices rise and decisions accelerate.

## The Supply-Demand Dance

```
                    High Demand + Low Supply = Premium Prices
                    High Demand + High Supply = Commodity Prices
                    Low Demand + Any Supply = Struggling Business
```

### The Goal

Create more demand than you satisfy. Always leave some prospects wanting.

> "We must endeavor to keep our supply (and satisfaction of desire) under the demand that we are able to generate. This maximizes profits and keeps desire ravenous in our customer base."

### Hormozi's Law of Demand

> **"The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make."**

The longer the runway, the bigger the plane that can take off.

**Application:**
- Build demand before making offers
- Don't immediately monetize every audience
- Let desire accumulate
- When you DO make the offer, make it big

Most entrepreneurs ask too soon, for too little.

### The Danger of Over-Satisfying

**Scenario 1: Satisfy all demand**
- 10 people want it at $500
- You sell to all 10
- Next time: No pent-up demand
- Result: Declining interest each cycle

**Scenario 2: Create scarcity**
- 10 people want it at $500
- You sell to 2 at $5,000
- Next time: 8 people still want it + new prospects
- Result: Growing demand, premium prices

> "The person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand."

## The Three Types of Scarcity

### Type 1: Limited Supply of Seats/Slots

**What it is:** Fixed number of spots available.

**Variations:**

| Method | Example | Best For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Total Business Cap | "We only service 25 clients. Period." | High-touch services |
| Growth Rate Cap | "We only accept 5 new clients per week." | Consistent lead gen |
| Cohort Cap | "We take 100 clients 4x per year." | Course/program launches |

**Scripts:**

**Total Cap:**
> "My agency only services 25 clients total. We have 2 openings. When those fill, you'll be on a waitlist until someone leaves - which rarely happens."

**Growth Rate Cap:**
> "We only accept 5 new clients per week and already have 3 spots taken. I have 6 more calls this week. You can take a spot now, or wait until we reopen next week."

**Cohort Cap:**
> "We start new clients quarterly. Our next cohort begins April 1st with 100 spots. We're at 73 enrolled. Once we hit 100, doors close until July."

### Type 2: Limited Supply of Bonuses

**What it is:** The offer is available, but special bonuses are limited.

**Script:**
> "Everyone gets the core program, but the first 20 people to enroll also get [valuable bonus] worth $X. We're at 14 claimed."

**Why it works:**
- Core offer remains available (no lost sales)
- Creates urgency for fast action
- Premium feels "earned" by early movers

### Type 3: Never Available Again

**What it is:** One-time opportunity that will literally never return.

**Script:**
> "This is a limited edition release. We made 100 and will never make them again. Once they're gone, they're gone forever."

**Best for:**
- Physical products (limited editions)
- Special collaborations
- Founding member opportunities
- One-time bonuses

---

## Scarcity by Business Type

### Physical Products

**Tactics:**
- Limited releases (colors, flavors, designs)
- Numbered editions ("237 of 500")
- Seasonal/one-time runs
- Collaboration pieces

**Key rule:** Always sell out. Better to sell out consistently than over-order and kill scarcity.

**The Chanel Example:**
> "Chanel sends only 1-2 of each piece to each store. Every store has different selection. Every item is the last or second-to-last in stock. This allows them to price far above market and turn buying impulses into purchases."

### Services

**Tactics:**
- Capacity limits (real)
- Onboarding windows
- Team bandwidth
- Calendar availability

**Script (Honest Scarcity):**
> "I couldn't handle 1,000 clients tomorrow - no one could. I can handle 5 new clients this week. We're at 3. Letting you know so you can decide if you want one of the remaining spots."

### Info Products / Courses

**Tactics:**
- Cohort-based enrollment
- Limited live components
- Bonus windows
- Beta/founding pricing

**Script:**
> "This round closes Friday. We run this program 3x per year with 200 spots per cohort. We're at 167. Next opportunity is September."

## The Sell-Out Strategy

### Why Selling Out Matters

When you sell out:
1. People who missed out want it MORE next time
2. Social proof: "It must be good if it sold out"
3. Next launch starts with pent-up demand
4. You can raise prices
5. Marketing writes itself: "Sold out in 4 hours"

### How to Guarantee Sell-Outs

1. **Estimate demand conservatively**
2. **Offer 70-80% of estimated demand**
3. **Announce the sell-out publicly**
4. **Create waitlist for future**
5. **Increase capacity slightly next time**
6. **Repeat**

> "The next time we promote scenario two, we then open three spots at the same price and sell them all (still leaving some prospects with pent up demand!)."

---

## Honest Scarcity

### The Principle

> "The easiest scarcity strategy is honesty. Simply letting people know that you are three-fourths of the way to capacity this week will move people over the edge."

You ACTUALLY have limits. Use them.

### What You Already Have

- Weekly client capacity
- Team bandwidth
- Calendar availability
- Product inventory
- Service delivery limits

### Script Examples

**Capacity:**
> "We're at 81% capacity in our business. We can take 4 more clients before we have to close enrollment."

**Calendar:**
> "I have 3 onboarding slots left this month. After that, you're looking at a 3-week wait."

**Team:**
> "My implementation team can handle 10 new clients per week. We're at 7 for this week."

### The Psychology

Scarcity implies social proof:
- "If they're 81% full, lots of people said yes"
- "If spots disappear fast, it must be good"
- "If I wait, I might miss out"

---

## Premium Access Scarcity

### The Extreme Version

> "If you don't hate money, sell a very limited supply of 1-on-1 access."

**Structure:**
- Tiny number of spots (3-5)
- Very high price
- Direct access to you
- Clear boundaries

**Script:**
> "I take 3 private clients per quarter. Direct access to me via Zoom, unlimited questions. $50,000 for the quarter. Applications open next Tuesday for 24 hours."

**Why it works:**
- The scarcity is REAL
- The value is OBVIOUS
- The price filters for serious people
- These become your best clients

### The "Once You're Out" Enhancement

> "You can create scarcity by capping your service level and saying that if they leave they can never return."

**Script:**
> "Once you leave this program, you can't come back. We don't re-admit former members. So think carefully before you decide to step away."

**Best for:** Small, high-touch groups where commitment matters.

## Making Scarcity Believable

### The Reason Why

Every scarcity claim needs justification:

| Claim | Weak | Strong |
|-------|------|--------|
| Limited spots | "Only 10 spots" | "Only 10 spots because each client gets 2 hours of my time weekly, and I cap my consulting at 20 hours" |
| Limited time | "Ends Friday" | "Ends Friday because we start the cohort Monday and need time to onboard everyone" |
| Limited quantity | "Only 100" | "Only 100 because that's how many we could produce with our specialty manufacturer" |

### Red Flags That Kill Credibility

- Scarcity that resets (countdown timers that restart)
- "Limited time" offers that never end
- Arbitrary limits with no explanation
- Scarcity claims that don't match observed behavior

### Building Trust

- Be honest about real limits
- Explain WHY the limit exists
- Honor your claims (actually close when you say)
- Show proof of sell-outs

---

## Scarcity + Other Enhancements

### Scarcity + Urgency

> "Only 5 spots left, and enrollment closes Friday at midnight."

### Scarcity + Bonuses

> "First 10 enrollees get [bonus]. We're at 7. Once we hit 10, bonus is gone."

### Scarcity + Guarantees

> "We only take 20 clients because we guarantee results. If we took more, we couldn't deliver on that promise."

- [ ] Create waitlist for overflow

### Step 4: Honor Your Word

- [ ] Actually close when you say
- [ ] Announce sell-outs publicly
- [ ] Don't make exceptions (or hide them)
- [ ] Build reputation for real scarcity

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Fake Scarcity

**Problem:** Evergreen countdown timers, infinite "last chance" emails
**Result:** Destroys credibility, trains customers to ignore

### Mistake 2: No Reason Why

**Problem:** "Only 10 spots!" with no explanation
**Result:** Seems arbitrary, less believable

### Mistake 3: Scarcity Without Demand

**Problem:** Limited spots for something no one wants
**Result:** Doesn't matter - build demand first

### Mistake 4: Too Much Scarcity

**Problem:** Everything is limited, always
**Result:** Scarcity fatigue, nothing feels special

## Summary

**Scarcity increases value by limiting supply:**

1. **Three types:** Limited seats, limited bonuses, never again
2. **Make it honest:** Your real limits ARE scarcity
3. **Sell out intentionally:** Leave demand unsatisfied
4. **Explain why:** Every limit needs a reason
5. **Announce results:** "Sold out" is marketing gold

> "When demand increases, cut supply." — George (Arnold's charity fundraiser)

The goal: Create ravenous demand by strategically under-satisfying it.
