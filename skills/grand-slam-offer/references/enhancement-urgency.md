# Urgency - Time Psychology

Urgency is a function of TIME. It decreases the action threshold by creating deadlines.

## The Core Principle

> "Deadlines. Drive. Decisions."

**Scarcity = quantity limits ("only 10 left")**
**Urgency = time limits ("ends Friday")**

Both work. They work even better together.

## The 50-60% Rule

> "The biggest sales on a week-long campaign happen in the last 4 hours of the last day - up to 50-60% of total sales."

**The math:**
- Last 4 hours = 2.4% of a 7-day campaign
- Those 4 hours produce 50-60% of sales
- That's 25x higher conversion rate at deadline

**The lesson:** Deadlines aren't optional. They're where the money is.

## The Four Urgency Tactics

### Tactic 1: Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency

**What it is:** New clients start on a regular schedule (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly).

**Why it works:**
- Creates natural deadlines
- Operational efficiency
- Built-in urgency without being "salesy"

**Script (Weekly starts):**
> "If you sign up today, I can get you in with our next group that kicks off Monday. Otherwise, you'll have to wait until the following Monday to start."

**Enhanced script:**
> "I actually had a client who signed up a few weeks ago drop out, so I have an opening for our next cohort that kicks off Monday. If you're pretty sure you're gonna do this sooner or later, might as well get in now so you can start reaping the rewards sooner rather than paying the same and waiting."

**Frequency impact:**
- Weekly starts = mild urgency
- Monthly starts = moderate urgency
- Quarterly starts = strong urgency
- Annual starts = maximum urgency

### Tactic 2: Rolling Seasonal Urgency

**What it is:** Time-bound promotions tied to seasons, holidays, or events.

**Why it works:**
- Gives legitimate start/end dates
- Fresh "wrapper" on same offer
- Culturally understood deadlines

**Example calendar:**
| Month | Promotion Name |
|-------|----------------|
| January | "New Year New You" |
| February | "Valentine's Lovers Promo" |
| March | "Sexy By Spring Special" |
| April | "Fools in Love Promo" |
| May | "Summer Ready Sale" |
| June | "Halfway There Push" |
| July | "Independence Day Special" |
| August | "Back to School Reset" |
| September | "Fall Fresh Start" |
| October | "Spooky Good Deal" |
| November | "Thanksgiving Transformation" |
| December | "Holiday Hangover Prevention" |

**Script:**
> "Our New Year Transformation Special ends January 31st. Same program will be available in February, but this pricing and bonus package won't be."

**Pro tip for local businesses:**
> "This is my number one strategy for local businesses. They must vary their marketing more frequently than national advertisers. Putting a new wrapper with a date on the same core service gives you urgency and novelty."

### Tactic 3: Pricing or Bonus-Based Urgency

**What it is:** The promotion/discount/bonus expires, not the offer itself.

**Why it works:**
- Honest (offer IS always available)
- Urgency on the deal, not the product
- Maintains pricing integrity

**Script:**
> "Yes, let's get you started today so you can take advantage of the discount you came in for. I'm not sure how long we'll be running it—we change them every 4 weeks or so—and this is one of the better ones we've had in a while."

**Variations:**
- Price increase deadline
- Bonus expiration
- Payment plan availability
- Free add-on deadline

**Price increase script:**
> "We're raising prices on the 1st. If you enroll before then, you lock in current pricing for life. After the 1st, it's $X more per month."

**Pro tip:**
> "Never raise your prices without letting people know. It shows a position of strength and will give you a nice little influx of cash from people in the pipeline who were on the fence."

### Tactic 4: Exploding Opportunity

**What it is:** The opportunity itself decays over time due to external factors.

**Why it works:**
- Based on real market dynamics
- Creates genuine FOMO
- Not artificially manufactured

**Examples:**
- Arbitrage opportunity closing as market corrects
- Platform advantage before competitors catch on
- Beta pricing before public launch
- First-mover advantage in emerging space

**Script:**
> "This arbitrage between [Platform A] and [Platform B] won't last forever. Every day more people discover it, the margins shrink. Six months ago you could 3x your money. Now it's 2x. In six more months, it might be break-even. The best day to start was yesterday. The second best day is today."

**Job offer version:**
> "This is an exploding offer. The package we're presenting today decreases by $5,000 for every day you wait to accept. We want people who are decisive."

## Handling Common Situations

### "What if someone wants to buy right after I started a cohort?"

**Option 1: Speed bonus**
> "Since the next group starts in 3 weeks, I can offer you an extended onboarding to get you up to speed as a bonus for signing up today."

**Option 2: Extended payment plan**
> "Since the start date is further out, you'll actually have more time to review the materials and prepare. Plus, I can stretch your payment plan over that time—an advantage most clients don't get."

### "What if I lose sales by turning business away?"

**Reality check:**
> "Every experienced marketer will tell you—it is a fear, and it is unfounded. The last 3% of time creates 50-60% of sales. People who don't buy at the deadline weren't going to buy without one either."

The people you "lose" were never going to buy. The people you gain from urgency far outweigh them.

### "Won't people just wait for the next promotion?"

**Solutions:**
1. Make each promotion genuinely different
2. Never repeat exact same offer
3. Vary bonuses, not core pricing
4. Build reputation for honoring deadlines
5. Occasionally don't run a promo (breaks pattern)

## Urgency by Business Type

| Business Type | Best Urgency Tactic |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Local services | Rolling seasonal |
| Coaching/courses | Cohort-based |
| Agency/consulting | Capacity + calendar |
| Physical products | Limited edition + seasonal |
| SaaS | Annual pricing + feature deadlines |
| Events | Registration + early bird |
| Info products | Launch windows |

## Creating Real Urgency vs. Fake Urgency

### Real Urgency (Do This)

- Cohorts that actually start on specific dates
- Prices that actually increase
- Bonuses that actually disappear
- Capacity that actually limits enrollment
- Seasonal promotions that actually end

### Fake Urgency (Avoid This)

- Countdown timers that reset
- "Ending soon" that never ends
- Prices that always go back down
- Unlimited "limited time" offers
- Recycled "last chance" emails

> "Make sure your deadlines are real. If they aren't, you'll lose credibility and just look like every other wannabe marketer."

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Primary Tactic

Based on business model:
- Cohort-based if you onboard in groups
- Seasonal if you run campaigns
- Bonus-based if you need flexibility
- Exploding if you have time-sensitive opportunity

### Step 2: Set Real Deadlines

- Mark on calendar
- Communicate early and often
- Honor them completely

### Step 3: Build the Sequence

**7-day campaign example:**
- Day 1: Announcement
- Day 3: Reminder + social proof
- Day 5: "Halfway" update
- Day 6: "Tomorrow is last day"
- Day 7 AM: "Hours remaining"
- Day 7 PM: "Final hours"
- Day 7 11pm: "Closing in 60 minutes"

### Step 4: Close Definitively

- Actually remove the offer
- Send "doors closed" message
- Create waitlist for next round
- Report results (sold out, etc.)

---

## Urgency + Other Enhancements

### Urgency + Scarcity

> "Only 5 spots remain, and enrollment closes Friday."

### Urgency + Bonuses

> "Enroll by Friday to get [bonus]. After Friday, the bonus is gone but the program is still available."

### Urgency + Guarantees

> "Our guarantee only applies to this cohort. If you wait for the next round, terms may change."

## Scripts Library

### Opening Urgency

> "Before we dive in, I want to let you know that our current promotion ends [date]. Everything we discuss today is available at this pricing until then."

### Mid-Conversation Urgency

> "One thing I should mention—we start our next group on [date]. If you want to be in that group, we'd need to get you enrolled by [deadline]."

### Closing Urgency

> "Here's where we are: This pricing is available until [date]. The next cohort starts [date]. If you want both the pricing AND the start date, we need to move forward today. What questions do you have?"

### Follow-Up Urgency

> "Just wanted to check in—the [promotion] we discussed ends [date]. I'd hate for you to miss the [bonus/pricing/start date] if you've decided this is right for you. Any questions I can answer?"

### Deadline Day Urgency

> "Today's the last day for [promotion]. Wanted to give you one final heads up before we close it down. If you're in, now's the time. If not, totally understand—you'll just catch us next round at the new pricing."

## Summary

**Urgency accelerates decisions by adding time constraints:**

1. **Cohort-based:** Natural start dates create deadlines
2. **Seasonal:** Holiday/event wrappers give legitimate end dates
3. **Bonus/pricing:** The deal expires, not the offer
4. **Exploding:** External factors create genuine decay

**Key numbers:**
- 50-60% of sales in last 4 hours
- Last 3% of time = majority of conversions
- Deadlines multiply decision-making

**The rule:** If you don't have a deadline, create one. If you have one, honor it completely.
