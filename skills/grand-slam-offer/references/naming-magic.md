# Naming - The M.A.G.I.C. Formula

> "Like the tree that falls in the forest that no one hears, having a Grand Slam Offer will not make you money if no one finds out about it."

Naming your offer correctly determines response rates, click-through rates, and ultimately, revenue.

## The M.A.G.I.C. Formula

| Letter | Component | Purpose | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **M** | Magnetic Reason Why | Why are you making this offer? | "Free," "88% Off," "Grand Opening" |
| **A** | Avatar | Who is this for? | "Busy Moms," "B2B Sales Reps," "Gym Owners" |
| **G** | Goal | What will they achieve? | "Pain Free," "Celebrity Smile," "Double Your Profit" |
| **I** | Interval | How long will it take? | "21-Day," "6-Week," "90-Day" |
| **C** | Container | What type of thing is it? | "Challenge," "Blueprint," "Bootcamp" |

**You don't need all five.** Use 3-5 components. Shorter and punchier beats longer and complete.

## Component Deep Dives

### M - Magnetic Reason Why

**Purpose:** Answers "Why are they making this great offer?" or "What's in it for me?"

**Think like a fraternity party planner:**
> "We had a party once because a guy got his wisdom teeth removed."

The reason can be ANYTHING. It just needs to exist.

**Categories:**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Price-based** | Free, 88% Off, $1 Trial, Pay What You Want |
| **Event-based** | Grand Opening, Anniversary, New Location |
| **Seasonal** | Spring, Summer, Back to School, Holiday |
| **Milestone** | 1000th Customer, 10 Year Anniversary |
| **Circumstantial** | New Management, Relaunch, Beta |

### A - Avatar

**Purpose:** Calls out exactly who this is for (and implicitly, who it's NOT for).

**Rules:**
- More specific = higher conversion
- Local beats general (Towson, not Baltimore)
- Include identifier they claim

**Examples by specificity:**

| Generic | Better | Best |
|---------|--------|------|
| "Business owners" | "Agency owners" | "B2B Lead Gen Agency Owners" |
| "Women" | "Moms" | "Busy Single Moms in Brooklyn" |
| "Professionals" | "Sales reps" | "B2B Outbound Power Tools Sales Reps" |

### G - Goal

**Purpose:** The dream outcome they want. Make it visceral.

**Categories:**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Physical state** | Pain Free, Lean, Toned, Energized |
| **Achievement** | 1st Place, Published, Featured |
| **Financial** | Six Figure, Double Your Profit, First $10K |
| **Social** | Celebrity Smile, Head-Turner, Envy-Worthy |
| **Emotional** | Stress-Free, Confident, Unstoppable |

**Make it status-enhancing:** What will others notice/say?

### I - Interval

**Purpose:** Time commitment / time to results.

**Common intervals:**
- Minutes/Hours: "60-Minute," "4-Hour"
- Days: "7-Day," "21-Day," "30-Day"
- Weeks: "6-Week," "12-Week"
- Months: "90-Day," "6-Month"

**Platform warning:**
> "If you're making any quantifiable claim (like income or weight loss), most platforms will not approve messaging with a stated duration because it implies a guarantee."

**Workaround:** Use interval without specific claim
- ✅ "21-Day Challenge"
- ❌ "Lose 20lbs in 21 Days"

### C - Container Word

**Purpose:** Signals this is a complete system/bundle, not a commodity.

**Container words by vibe:**

| Vibe | Container Words |
|------|-----------------|
| **Action** | Challenge, Sprint, Bootcamp, Intensive, Attack, Assault |
| **Strategic** | Blueprint, System, Playbook, Framework, Method |
| **Transformation** | Transformation, Makeover, Reset, Rebirth, Comeback |
| **Learning** | Masterclass, Workshop, Deep Dive, Academy |
| **Acceleration** | Fast Track, Accelerator, Shortcut, Catapult, Slingshot |
| **Community** | Mastermind, Summit, Experience, Meetup |
| **Premium** | VIP, Elite, Insider, Private |

## Power Moves

### Rhyming

> "Good rhymes stick in people's minds. Rhyme your program name to win the game."

**Examples:**
- "Six-Pack Fast Track"
- "5-Day Book Print Sprint"
- "Marriage Thrive Deep Dive"
- "12-Week 2-Putt Shortcut"
- "12-Month No-Debt Reset"

**Tool:** Google "rhyming dictionary"

**Rule:** Don't force it. It's a nice-to-have, not a requirement.

### Alliteration

**Definition:** Words starting with same letter/sound.

**Examples:**
- "Make Money Masterclass"
- "Big Booty Bootcamp"
- "Debt Detox"
- "Real Estate Reset"
- "Life Coach Liftoff"

Easier than rhyming for most people. Same memorability benefit.

## The Variation Hierarchy

When offers fatigue, change in THIS order:

| Priority | What to Change | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | Creative (images/videos) | New video, same offer |
| 2 | Body copy | New angles, same offer |
| 3 | Headline/Name (M.A.G.I.C.) | "Lean Challenge" → "Tone Challenge" |
| 4 | Duration | 6 weeks → 8 weeks |
| 5 | Enhancer (free/discount) | Free → 88% off |
| 6 | Monetization structure | Only as last resort |

**Key insight:**
> "We are not changing the actual offer. We are only changing the wrapping paper."

Same core offer. Different wrapper. Fresh response.

### Same Offer, Different Wrappers

**January:** "New Year New You 6-Week Challenge"
**February:** "Valentine's Lovers Transformation"
**March:** "Sexy By Spring 6-Week System"
**April:** "Fools in Love Fitness Fast Track"

Same program. Same delivery. Same price. Different name = renewed interest.

---

## Naming Sub-Components

Use M.A.G.I.C. for bonuses and components too:

**Weak component names:**
- "Video training"
- "Checklist"
- "Guide"
- "Template"

**Strong component names:**
- "The 20-Minute Grocery Blitz System"
- "Never-Miss-A-Step Implementation Checklist"
- "Live It Up While Slimming Down Restaurant Guide"
- "Copy-Paste Client Getting Email Templates"

Every piece of your offer deserves a compelling name.

---

## Testing Names

### Process

1. Create 3-5 name variations
2. Run same ad with different headlines
3. Measure click-through rate
4. Winner becomes control
5. Test new variations against control
6. Repeat

### What to Test

- Different avatars (same offer)
- Different goals (same offer)
- Different containers (same offer)
- Different intervals (same offer)
- With/without reason why

### Sample A/B Test

**Control:** "6-Week Fitness Challenge"
**Test A:** "Free 6-Week Busy Mom Fitness Challenge"
**Test B:** "6-Week Bikini Body Blueprint"
**Test C:** "42-Day Total Transformation System"

Run for 1,000 impressions each. Best CTR wins.

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Generic

**Bad:** "Weight Loss Program"
**Good:** "21-Day Busy Mom Bikini Blueprint"

### Mistake 2: Too Long

**Bad:** "The Complete 12-Week Total Body Transformation System for Busy Professional Women Who Want to Look Amazing"
**Good:** "12-Week Busy Pro Body Blueprint"

### Mistake 3: No Container

**Bad:** "Lose Weight Fast"
**Good:** "Lose Weight Fast Challenge"

Container implies system, structure, completeness.

### Mistake 4: Vague Goal

**Bad:** "Feel Better Program"
**Good:** "Pain-Free in 30 Days Program"

Specific and measurable beats vague every time.

### Mistake 5: Wrong Avatar

**Bad:** "Everyone's Fitness" (no one identifies)
**Good:** "Lakeway Moms' Fitness" (immediate identification)

## Summary

**The M.A.G.I.C. formula makes offers irresistible:**

1. **M**agnetic reason why - Why this offer exists
2. **A**vatar - Who it's for (specifically)
3. **G**oal - What they'll achieve
4. **I**nterval - How long it takes
5. **C**ontainer - What type of thing it is

**Power moves:** Rhyme or alliterate for memorability

**When offers fatigue:** Change the wrapper (name), not the core offer

**Test everything:** The market decides what works, not you
