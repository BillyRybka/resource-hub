# Market Selection - Finding Your Starving Crowd

> "If you were going to open a hotdog stand, and you could only have one advantage over your competitors... a starving crowd."

---

## The Hierarchy of Success

```
Starving Crowd (Market) > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills
```

**Translation:**
- Great market + bad offer = make money
- Bad market + great offer = struggle
- Great market + great offer = fortune

### The Toilet Paper Example

**COVID toilet paper shortage:**
- No compelling offer
- Atrocious pricing  
- No sales pitch
- Result: $100+ per roll

**Why?** The crowd was starving. Nothing else mattered.

## The Newspaper Cautionary Tale

### The Setup

Lloyd had a software business serving newspapers:
- Great product (digital ad services)
- Great offer (pay only on revenue generated - zero risk)
- Natural sales ability
- Still declining year after year

### The Problem

**Not the product. Not the offer. Not the sales skills.**

The market was shrinking 25% per year.

> "He had looked at all the angles, except for the most obvious one."

### The Pivot

When COVID hit, Lloyd started an automated mask manufacturing company.

**Same entrepreneur. Different market.**

Within 5 months: millions per month in revenue.

> "He applied his same skill set to a business he had zero experience in and was able to win. That's the power of picking the right market."

## The Four Market Criteria

### 1. Massive Pain

**Question:** Do they NEED this solved (not just want)?

**Signs of massive pain:**
- They're actively searching for solutions
- They've tried multiple things that failed
- The problem affects daily life/business
- They talk about it without prompting
- They'd pay almost anything to solve it

**Pain levels:**

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Inconvenience | Mildly annoying | Slow wifi |
| Problem | Regular frustration | Bad back |
| Crisis | Urgent, consuming | Business failing |
| Existential | Life/death | Serious illness |

**Target:** Problems, crises, or existential. Never inconveniences.

> "The degree of the pain will be proportional to the price you will be able to charge."

### 2. Purchasing Power

**Question:** Can they actually pay premium prices?

**The resume writer trap:**
> "A friend had a very good system for helping people improve their resumes... But they were all unemployed!"

Massive pain. Zero purchasing power.

**Check for:**
- Current income/revenue level
- Access to capital (savings, credit, investors)
- Budget authority (can they decide to spend?)
- Willingness to invest in solutions

**Rule:** Your targets need access to the money required for your prices.

### 3. Easy to Target

**Question:** Can you reach 10,000+ of them affordably?

**Good targeting indicators:**
- Professional associations
- Industry publications/websites
- Social media groups
- Email lists
- Physical locations (for local)
- Clear identifying behaviors

**Bad targeting indicators:**
- "Anyone who wants to..."
- "People who are thinking about..."
- Broad demographics only
- No gathering places

> "If searching them out is like finding needles in a haystack, then it can be very difficult to get your offer in front of any potentially interested eyes."

### 4. Growing

**Question:** Is the market stable or expanding?

**Growing market = tailwind.** Everything is easier.
**Shrinking market = headwind.** Everything is harder.

**How to check:**
- Industry reports
- Google Trends
- Job posting trends
- Investment activity
- News coverage

**Lloyd's newspaper lesson:**
> "Three of the four makings of a great market: lots of pain, purchasing power, easy to target. But they were shrinking. No matter how hard he tried, the entire marketplace was fighting against him."

---

## The Three Core Markets

**All lasting markets ladder up to:**

| Market | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Health** | Fitness, nutrition, medical, mental health, wellness |
| **Wealth** | Business, investing, career, income, savings |
| **Relationships** | Dating, marriage, family, friendship, social skills |

> "These will always exist because there is always tremendous pain when you lack them."

**Your niche:** Find a sub-group within one of these three that hits all four criteria.

---

## The Niching Decision

### Why Niching Works

**Same product, 100x price:**

| Niche Level | Product | Price |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Generic | "Time Management" | $19 |
| Industry | "Time Management for Sales" | $99 |
| Role | "Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales" | $499 |
| Specific | "Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools Sales" | $2,000 |

> "The more specific and tangible, the better."

### The "Second Half of Life" Example

**If you're a relationship expert:**

| Option | Pain | Money | Targeting | Growth |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| College students | Medium | Low | Easy | Stable |
| Senior citizens | High | High | Easy | Growing |

**Seniors win:** More pain (loneliness, mortality), more money (retirement savings), easy to target (AARP, senior centers), growing market (more turning 65 than 20).

### The Commitment Rule

> "Don't make me niche slap you."

**The mistake:** Try one offer in one market → doesn't make millions → "This is a bad market!" → switch to different niche → repeat forever

**The reality:** Both dentists and chiropractors are billion-dollar markets. Either would work. Just not both.

> "If you keep hopping from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be niche slapped."

### How Long to Commit

> "You must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error. You will fail. You will fail until you succeed."

**Minimum commitment:** 100 offers tested
**Expected timeline:** 6-24 months
**Required mindset:** "This is my market. I will figure it out."

## Market Selection vs. Offer Quality

### The Interaction

| | Bad Market | Normal Market | Great Market |
|---|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Bad Offer** | Disaster | Struggle | Make money |
| **Normal Offer** | Struggle | Okay business | Good business |
| **Great Offer** | Struggle | Great business | Massive success |

**Key insight:** Great market can save bad offer. Great offer can't save bad market.

### Realistic Expectations

> "It's unlikely you are going to be in a dying market like the newspaper example. It's also unlikely you're going to be selling toilet paper in COVID. You'll likely be in a 'normal' market. And that's totally okay."

**Normal market + Grand Slam Offer = exceptional results**

---

## When to Broaden

### The $10M Rule

> "For most, if you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money."

**Below $10M:** Go narrower, not wider
**Above $10M:** May need to expand (depends on TAM)

### Ways to Expand

| Direction | Definition | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Up market | Serve larger clients | Small gyms → Large gyms |
| Down market | Serve smaller clients | Large gyms → Home trainers |
| Adjacent | Serve related needs | Gym owners → Fitness influencers |

### The Reality Check

> "Many companies expanded to $30M+ per year serving a single niche: Chiropractors, Gyms, Plumbers, Solar, Roofers, Salon Owners, etc. If you are at $1M or $3M, thinking you have capped and must expand, you are wrong. You just need to be better."

## Summary

**Market selection determines your ceiling:**

1. **Starving crowd beats everything** — Pain > Offer > Skills
2. **Four criteria:** Pain, Money, Targeting, Growth
3. **Three core markets:** Health, Wealth, Relationships
4. **Niching enables premium** — Specificity justifies price
5. **Commit fully** — 100 offers before switching
6. **Normal is fine** — Grand Slam Offer makes normal exceptional

> "The grass is never greener once you get to the other side. If you keep hopping from niche to niche, you deserve to be niche slapped."

Pick. Commit. Win.
