# Premium Pricing - Charging What It's Worth

> "Charge as high a price as you can say out loud without cracking a smile." — Dan Kennedy

## The Pricing Mistake Most Make

**The typical process:**
1. Look at marketplace
2. See what competitors charge
3. Take the average
4. Go slightly below to be "competitive"
5. Offer "a little more" than competitors
6. End up with "more for less" value prop

**The problem:** Those competitors are broke. Why copy them?

> "Pricing where the market is means you're pricing for market efficiency... business owners make just enough at the end of the month to keep going."

---

## The Strategic Advantage of Premium

> "There is no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest in the marketplace, but there is for being the most expensive."

**Second cheapest:** No differentiation, thin margins, constant price pressure
**Most expensive:** Implied quality, fat margins, competitive moat

## The Virtuous Cycle of Price

### When You Raise Prices, You:

| Effect | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Increase client emotional investment | They pay attention, do the work |
| Increase perceived value | "It must be good if it costs that much" |
| Increase client results | Investment = commitment = outcomes |
| Attract best clients | Serious people, easier to work with |
| Multiply margin | Invest in better delivery, people, systems |

**The flywheel spins faster:** Better clients → Better results → Better testimonials → Higher prices → Better clients

### When You Lower Prices, You:

| Effect | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Decrease emotional investment | They don't take it seriously |
| Decrease perceived value | "How good can it be for $29?" |
| Decrease client results | No commitment = no follow-through |
| Attract worst clients | Price shoppers, complainers, refunders |
| Destroy margin | Can't invest in improvement |

**The death spiral:** Worse clients → Worse results → Worse reputation → Lower prices → Worse clients

## Price Creates Value (Literally)

### The Wine Study

**Setup:** Researchers gave participants three wines labeled as low-priced, medium-priced, and expensive. They rated them in order of price—expensive was "best."

**The twist:** All three wines were identical.

**The lesson:** 
> "Raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide."

Price IS a quality signal. Higher price = higher perceived value = higher actual satisfaction.

### The Implication

> "The higher the price, the more allure your product or service has. People want to buy expensive things. They just need a reason."

Your job: Give them the reason.

## The Conviction Requirement

Premium pricing requires conviction. You must BELIEVE your offer delivers.

### Where Conviction Comes From

| Source | How to Build It |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Results** | Track every client outcome obsessively |
| **Volume** | Do it so many times success becomes expected |
| **Specificity** | Know exactly who you help and how |
| **Testimonials** | Collect proof of transformation |
| **Comparison** | Calculate ROI vs. alternatives |

### The Hormozi Example

> "I was selling this to grown men as a kid in my twenties, telling them I was going to help them make more money."

**How?**
- Average gym owner: $35,280/year take-home
- After 11 months with Gym Launch: +$239,000/year revenue
- Price: $42,000/year

**The math made conviction easy:** $42K for $239K = no-brainer

> "My conviction was stronger than their skepticism."

### Building Your Conviction

Ask yourself:
1. What's the average outcome for my clients?
2. What's that outcome worth in dollars (or equivalent)?
3. What's my price as a percentage of that value?
4. Can I say my price with complete confidence?

If you can't say your price without flinching, you either:
- Need more proof (go get results)
- Need to improve your offer (use Value Equation)
- Need to practice saying it (just reps)

## Investment Drives Commitment

> "If you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as humanly possible."

### The Paradox

**Low price thinking:** "I'll charge less so more people can afford it and get help"

**Reality:** Low price = low commitment = low results = you helped no one

**High price thinking:** "I'll charge more so people are invested and actually do the work"

**Reality:** High price = high commitment = high results = you actually helped them

### The Sting Principle

> "Price your services in such a way that it stings a little when they buy. That sting will force and focus their attention."

**Those who pay the most, pay the most attention.**

---

## Premium Price Positioning

### Creating "Category of One"

> "The goal isn't just to be slightly above the market price—the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks, 'This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.'"

| Position | Consumer Thought | Result |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| 10% higher | "That's a bit pricey" | Price comparison continues |
| 100% higher | "Hmm, what's different?" | Curiosity, but still comparing |
| 1000% higher | "This must be completely different" | Category of one |

**Hormozi's approach:**
- Low-price competitors: $500/month
- High-price competitor: $5,000 total
- Gym Launch: $16,000 + $42,000/year ongoing

**32x the low end. 3x the high end.** Category of one.

### The Question to Trigger

You want prospects thinking:
> "This is so expensive, they must know something others don't."

NOT:
> "This is a bit more expensive, is it worth it?"

## The Math of Premium

### Scenario: Commodity Pricing

- 100 leads
- 10% close rate = 10 clients
- $1,000 price = $10,000 revenue
- $500 fulfillment cost = $5,000 profit
- $5,000 ad spend = $0 net

**Result:** You work for free.

### Scenario: Premium Pricing

- 100 leads
- 5% close rate = 5 clients (lower, harder sell)
- $10,000 price = $50,000 revenue
- $1,000 fulfillment cost = $45,000 profit
- $5,000 ad spend = $40,000 net

**Result:** Even with half the close rate, 8x the profit.

### The Breakeven Insight

Premium pricing has so much margin that you can:
- Afford lower close rates
- Afford higher refund rates
- Afford better fulfillment
- Afford client acquisition costs others can't
- Afford to invest in growth

## Niching for Premium

### The 100x Price Principle

Same product, different niche = 100x price difference.

| Product | Price |
|---------|-------|
| "Time Management Course" | $19 |
| "Time Management for Sales Professionals" | $99 |
| "Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales" | $499 |
| "Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools Sales" | $2,000 |

**Same core content. Different specificity. 100x price range.**

### Why Niching Enables Premium

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Perceived fit** | "This was made exactly for me" |
| **Reduced competition** | Fewer direct comparisons |
| **Increased expertise** | You understand their specific world |
| **Higher results** | Tailored = more effective |
| **Referral network** | Industry word travels |

## Overcoming Price Objections

### Reframe: Investment vs. Cost

**Cost framing:** "It's $10,000"
**Investment framing:** "It's $10,000, and based on our average client results of $50,000 in the first year, that's a 5x return"

### Reframe: Relative Value

**Absolute framing:** "$42,000 is a lot of money"
**Relative framing:** "$42,000 to make an extra $239,000 is paying 17 cents on the dollar"

### Reframe: Total Cost of Problem

**Surface objection:** "That's expensive"
**Deeper question:** "What's it costing you NOT to solve this?"

Calculate:
- Money lost per month/year
- Time wasted
- Opportunity cost
- Emotional toll
- Compounding effect

### The Dad Conversation

Hormozi's father: "Is it legal what you're doing? Do they know they're paying you that much?"

Hormozi's response:
> "If I made you $239,000 extra this year, would you pay me $42,000?"

"For sure."

> "And how much would you have to pay up front?"

"Nothing."

"Oh... well then yeah, I would do it."

## When to Raise Prices

### Signals You're Underpriced

- [ ] Close rate above 50% (too easy)
- [ ] Never get price objections (price not pushing)
- [ ] Clients don't take it seriously (low commitment)
- [ ] Margin too thin to improve (can't invest)
- [ ] Competitors charge more for less (leaving money)

### How to Raise Prices

1. **Announce** the increase (creates urgency)
2. **Clean pipeline** with deadline
3. **Grandfather** existing clients (optional)
4. **Implement** on new clients
5. **Track** results (close rate, client quality, outcomes)
6. **Repeat** until close rate hits target (20-30%)

> "Never raise your prices without letting people know. It shows a position of strength and will give you a nice little influx of cash from the people in the pipeline who were on the fence."

## Premium Pricing Conviction Script

For when you need to say your price:

> "The investment for [Program] is [Price].
> 
> Now, I know that might sound like a lot. And honestly, if I weren't confident we could [specific outcome], I wouldn't charge it.
> 
> But here's the thing: our average client sees [specific result] within [timeframe]. At that point, this investment pays for itself [X] times over.
> 
> The way I see it, you're not paying [Price] for a [product/service]. You're investing [Price] to get [outcome worth much more].
> 
> Does that make sense?"

---

## Summary

**Premium pricing is a choice—and it's the right one:**

1. **Virtuous cycle:** Higher prices → better clients → better results → higher prices
2. **Price = value signal:** Higher price literally increases perceived value
3. **Conviction required:** You must believe before they will
4. **Investment drives results:** Those who pay most, pay most attention
5. **Category of one:** Be so expensive they can't compare you
6. **Math works:** Even with lower close rates, much higher profit
7. **Niche enables premium:** Specificity justifies higher prices

> "99% of businesses need to raise their prices to grow, not lower them. Profit is oxygen. It fuels the fire of growth."
