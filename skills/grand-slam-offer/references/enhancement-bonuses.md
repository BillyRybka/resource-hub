# Bonuses - Value Stacking Mastery

Bonuses expand the price-to-value discrepancy and get people to buy who otherwise wouldn't.

## The Core Principle

> "A single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses."

**Why this works:**
- Each bonus expands perceived value
- Subconsciously communicates core offer must be valuable (bonuses are "extras")
- Addresses specific objections one at a time
- Creates "how can I NOT buy this?" moment

This is why every infomercial says "But wait... there's more!"

## The 10 Bonus Bullets

### 1. Always Offer Bonuses

Never present a core offer without bonuses. Even if you were going to include these things anyway, separate them out and present them as added value.

### 2. Give Each Bonus a Special Name with Benefit

**Weak:** "Video training module"
**Strong:** "The 20-Minute Grocery Blitz System"

**Weak:** "Checklist"
**Strong:** "The Never-Miss-A-Step Implementation Checklist"

### 3. Tell the Complete Story

For each bonus, cover:

| Element | What to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Relation** | How it connects to their problem |
| **What** | What it actually is |
| **Origin** | How you discovered/created it |
| **Improvement** | How it will make their life better |

**Example:**
> "One thing I noticed working with clients is they always struggled with eating out (relation). So I created the 'Live It Up While Slimming Down' Eating Out Guide (what). After testing with 500+ clients, I documented exactly which items to order at 47 popular restaurants (origin). Now you can enjoy dinners with friends without worrying about derailing your progress (improvement)."

### 4. Provide Proof

Each bonus should have credibility:
- Stat: "Used by 10,000+ customers"
- Past client: "Sarah used this to lose 12 lbs in her first month"
- Personal: "I used this exact system when I lost 50 lbs"

### 5. Paint a Vivid Mental Image

Describe life AFTER using the bonus:

> "Imagine walking into any restaurant, confidently ordering exactly what you want, and waking up the next day lighter than the day before. That's what this guide makes possible."

### 6. Assign a Price Tag and Justify It

Every bonus needs a dollar value with reasoning:

**Justification methods:**
- Time value: "Saves 10 hours = $500 at $50/hour"
- Money saved: "Saves $200/month on groceries = $2,400/year"
- Alternative cost: "Personal nutritionist charges $300/session × 10 = $3,000"
- Results value: "Gets you results 3 weeks faster = worth $1,000"

### 7. Tools & Checklists > Trainings

**Higher value perception:**
- Checklists
- Templates
- Swipe files
- Calculators
- Scripts

**Lower value perception:**
- More training videos
- Additional modules
- Extra content

**Why:** Tools require less effort and time (bottom of Value Equation).

### 8. Address Specific Obstacles

Each bonus should solve a specific objection:

| Objection | Bonus That Solves It |
|-----------|---------------------|
| "I travel a lot" | Travel Workout & Eating Guide |
| "I eat out often" | Restaurant Survival Guide |
| "My family won't eat this" | Family-Friendly Meal Conversion Kit |
| "I don't have time" | 5-Minute Meal System |
| "I'll forget what to do" | Daily Action Checklist |

### 9. Solve Their NEXT Problem

Think ahead: What will they need after they start?

**Course about getting clients:**
- Bonus: Client Onboarding System
- Bonus: Retention Scripts
- Bonus: Upsell Templates

**Weight loss program:**
- Bonus: Maintenance Phase Guide
- Bonus: Wardrobe Transition Tips
- Bonus: Progress Photo Guide

### 10. Total Bonus Value Should Eclipse Core Offer

If your core offer is $997, bonuses should total $3,000-$10,000.

**This creates the "snap":** The price-to-value discrepancy becomes so large it breaks their resistance.

---

## Presenting Bonuses: 1-on-1 vs. Group

### One-on-One Sales

**Sequence:**
1. Present core offer
2. Ask for the sale
3. If YES → Reveal bonuses as surprise ("You're also going to get...")
4. If NO → Present bonus that matches their objection → Ask again
5. Repeat with additional bonuses as needed

**Script for handling objection:**
> "I totally understand. You know what, because [their objection], I want to add something. [Present relevant bonus]. Does that feel fair enough?"

**Why it works:** People have a hard time rejecting reciprocity. You're adding value to accommodate their concern.

### Group/Webinar Sales

**Sequence:**
1. Present core offer with value
2. Stack each bonus one at a time
3. Build running total
4. Show massive discrepancy at end
5. Add urgency/scarcity to bonuses

---

## Bonus Presentation Template

For each bonus, use this structure:

```
BONUS #[X]: [Catchy Name with Benefit]

[One sentence: What it is and who it's for]

Here's what happened... [Origin story - how you discovered/created it]

What you get:
• [Specific component 1]
• [Specific component 2]  
• [Specific component 3]

This means you'll be able to [vivid outcome description].

[Proof element - stat, testimonial, or personal result]

If you were to [buy alternative / hire expert / figure this out yourself], 
it would cost you [justified amount].

Value: $[X]
```

---

## Adding Scarcity & Urgency to Bonuses

Bonuses become MORE powerful with scarcity/urgency.

### Bonuses with Scarcity

**Version 1 - Exclusive access:**
> "Only people who sign up for [Program] will have access to [Bonus] - it's never for sale anywhere else."

**Version 2 - Limited quantity:**
> "I have 3 tickets left to my $5,000 live event. Sign up today and one is yours as a bonus."

### Bonuses with Urgency

**Version 1 - Time-limited:**
> "If you enroll today, I'll include [Bonus] valued at $1,000. This bonus expires at midnight."

**Version 2 - Rewarding action:**
> "I add this bonus for action-takers only. Enroll in the next 24 hours and it's yours."

## Partner/Affiliate Bonuses (Advanced)

Get other businesses to provide bonuses for FREE in exchange for exposure to your customers.

### How It Works

1. Identify businesses that serve your customers' NEXT need
2. Negotiate free products/services as bonuses
3. They get exposure to qualified prospects (your customers)
4. You get high-value bonuses at zero cost
5. Optional: Negotiate affiliate commission for referrals

### Example: Pain Clinic Offer

**Partner bonuses secured:**
- 2 free massage sessions from local therapist ($100 value)
- 2 free chiropractic adjustments ($100 value)
- Discount on anti-inflammatory foods ($50 savings)
- Discounts on braces/orthotics ($150 savings)
- Free personal training session + 1 month pool access ($100 value)
- Pharmacy discounts on relevant medications ($100/month savings)

**Total partner bonus value:** $600+ (covers your entire price if offer is $400)

### The Jedi Move

Negotiate BOTH:
1. Group discount for your customers
2. Commission to you for referrals

**Example (Supplement company):**
- Customers get 30% discount (they love you)
- You get 40% commission on sales (you make money)
- Partner gets customers (they win)

**Everyone wins.**

### Partner Bonus Script

> "I have [X] customers who will need [your service] after working with me. I'd like to include [your product/service] as a bonus in my offer. In exchange, you'll get exposure to highly qualified prospects. Would you be open to providing [specific offer] for my customers?"

## What Should Be a Bonus vs. Core Offer?

### Make It a Bonus When:

- It's short but high-quality (would get lost in main content)
- It can almost stand on its own
- It addresses a specific subset of customers
- It has high perceived value but low time investment
- It's a tool/template/checklist (condenses information)
- You want to highlight it specifically

### Keep It in Core Offer When:

- It's essential to the main transformation
- It requires significant time investment
- It builds on previous content sequentially
- Removing it would hurt results

### The Wow Factor Test

> "Would this make someone say 'wow, I didn't expect that' if they discovered it after purchasing?"

If yes → Make it a bonus
If no → Keep in core offer

## Pro Tips

### Never Discount - Add Bonuses Instead

> "When trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer. It teaches customers your prices are negotiable. Adding bonuses to increase value is far superior—it puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness."

### The Bonus Ladder

When handling objections, don't reveal all bonuses at once:

1. First objection → Bonus 1
2. Second objection → Bonus 2
3. Third objection → Bonus 3

Each feels like a personal accommodation. They feel obligated to say yes.

### Information Products as Bonuses

Perfect because:
- High perceived value
- Zero marginal cost
- No operational effort (just add login)
- Can be created once, used forever

### Event Tickets as Bonuses

Perfect because:
- High perceived value
- Fixed cost regardless of attendees
- Creates urgency (date-bound)
- Opportunity to upsell at event
