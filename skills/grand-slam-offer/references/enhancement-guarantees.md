# Guarantees - Risk Reversal Mastery

The single greatest objection for any product or service is RISK. Guarantees remove it.

## The Power of Guarantees

> "The right guarantee can 2-4x conversion rates by removing the risk of saying yes."

### The Math That Proves It

**Without strong guarantee:**
- 100 sales
- 5% refund rate = 5 refunds
- Net sales = 95

**With strong guarantee:**
- 130 sales (30% increase from reduced risk)
- 10% refund rate = 13 refunds (doubled)
- Net sales = 117

**Result: 23% more net sales even with DOUBLE the refund rate**

> "Don't be emotional, just do the math."

## The Four Guarantee Types

### Type 1: Unconditional

**Definition:** No questions asked refund. Period.

**Strength:** Maximum risk reversal for prospect
**Weakness:** Maximum risk for you; can attract tire-kickers

**Best for:**
- Low ticket items (< $100)
- Impulse purchases
- When you need differentiation
- When refund costs are minimal

### Type 2: Conditional

**Definition:** Refund IF they do specific things and don't get results.

**Strength:** Filters out lazy refunders; drives compliance
**Weakness:** Requires tracking; more complex communication

**Best for:**
- Mid to high ticket items
- Programs requiring action
- When you have clear success criteria
- Educational/coaching offers

### Type 3: Anti-Guarantee

**Definition:** "All sales are final" (with compelling reason why).

**Strength:** Zero refund risk; implies extreme value
**Weakness:** Reduces conversions; requires strong positioning

**Best for:**
- Ultra-exclusive access
- Proprietary information that can't be "unseen"
- Services with high fulfillment costs
- Screening for serious buyers only

### Type 4: Implied (Performance-Based)

**Definition:** Payment tied to results (revshare, pay-per-result, etc.)

**Strength:** Perfect alignment; zero risk for client
**Weakness:** Cash flow challenges; requires trust/tracking

**Best for:**
- Agency/service businesses
- High-ticket consulting
- When you control outcome variables
- Relationship-based engagements

## The Guarantee Formula

Every strong guarantee follows this structure:

```
If you don't get [X result] in [Y time period], we will [Z action].
```

**Weak:** "We guarantee your satisfaction."
**Strong:** "If you don't lose 20 pounds in 90 days, we'll refund every penny AND pay for your next program."

## 15+ Guarantee Examples with Scripts

### Unconditional Guarantees

#### 1. No Questions Asked Refund

**Script:**
> "I'm not asking you to decide yes or no today. I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision. The only way to do that is on the inside, not the outside.
> 
> Whether it's 29 minutes or 29 days from now, if you ain't happy, I ain't happy. For any reason whatsoever, if you want your money back, just email support@xyz.com and say 'gimme my money' and you got it.
> 
> You can only make such a guarantee when you're confident what you have is the real deal."

#### 2. Satisfaction-Based Refund

**Script (used for 4,000+ sales with only 2 refunds):**
> "Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did?
> 
> I'm not guaranteeing you're going to hit this goal in six weeks—I can't eat the food for you. But I AM guaranteeing you will get $500 worth of value and service from us.
> 
> If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I'll write you a check the day you tell me we suck."

**Best case/worst case close:**
> "Best case, you get the body of your dreams. Worst case, you tell me I suck, I write you a check, and you get six weeks of free training. Both options are risk free. But the only thing guaranteed NOT to help you is walking out of here today."

---

### Conditional Guarantees

#### 3. Outsized Refund (2x or 3x)

**Script (Jason Fladlien - generated extra $2.75M in sales):**
> "If you buy this course and spend $X on advertising using the methods herein, and don't make money, I will buy your store from you for $25,000, no questions asked."

**Conditions:**
- Must spend $X on ads
- Must follow the methods
- Must submit proof

**Result:** Only 10 payouts on $3M additional sales = extremely profitable

#### 4. Service Guarantee

**Script:**
> "If you don't achieve [specific goal] within our program timeline, we'll continue working with you for free until you do—up to 6 additional months of support at no additional cost."

**Why it works:**
- You never give money back
- You guarantee the OUTCOME
- Most people who do the work succeed before needing it
- Those who do need it are grateful, not refunding

> "Since I have been advising businesses to use this guarantee, I have yet to have a single person say a client took them up on it."

#### 5. Modified Service Guarantee

**Script:**
> "If you don't hit [X result] in the first 90 days, you get another full 90 days of access and support completely free. That's 6 months total for the price of 3."

**Why it works:**
- Fixed additional time commitment
- Easier to manage operationally
- Still feels like massive risk reversal

#### 6. Personal Service Guarantee

**Script:**
> "If you complete all the modules, submit all assignments, and don't achieve [result] within 60 days, I will personally work with you one-on-one until you do."

- When you have multiple offerings
- Maintaining customer relationship

#### 8. Delayed Second Payment Guarantee

**Script:**
> "We won't charge your second payment until after you [get first result]. Close your first sale, and then we bill you. If you don't close one, you don't pay more."

**Why it works:**
- Gets them focused on first win
- Proves you're confident in your system
- Reduces perceived risk of commitment

#### 9. First Outcome Guarantee

**Script:**
> "If you don't make your first sale in 14 days, we'll pay for your ad spend until you do."

**Why it works:**
- Covers their ancillary costs
- Focuses everyone on getting the first win
- Once first sale happens, momentum builds

#### 10. Hotel + Airfare Guarantee

**Why it works:**

- Makes attendance feel completely risk-free

**Best for:**
- Businesses with enforceable contracts

### Anti-Guarantees

#### 13. All Sales Final (Proprietary Information)

**Script:**
> "All sales are final. Here's why:
> 
> We're going to show you our proprietary process that we're using RIGHT NOW to generate leads. Our funnels, ads, and metrics. We're exposing the inner workings of our business.
> 
> Once you see it, you can't unsee it. That's why we don't offer refunds."

#### 14. All Sales Final (Serious Buyers Only)

**Script:**
> "If you're the type of customer who needs a guarantee before taking a jump, then you are not the type of person we want to work with.
> 
> We want motivated self-starters who can follow instructions and are not looking for a way out before they even begin.
> 
> If you are not serious, don't buy it. But if you are, boy are you going to make a killing."

### Implied Guarantees (Performance-Based)

#### 15. Pay Per Result

**Structure:** $X per sale, $X per lead, $X per show

**Script:**

#### 16. Revenue Share

**Script:**
> "We take 10% of the revenue we help you generate. If we make you nothing, you pay us nothing. We only win when you win."

#### 17. Profit Share with Ratchets

**Script:**
> "The better we do for you, the more we make. We're incentivized to help you hit higher and higher levels."

> "I've seen countless agencies go from $20k/mo to $200k+/mo in a matter of a few months" by switching to performance models.

## Stacking Guarantees

You can combine guarantees for maximum impact.

### Example Stack 1: Unconditional + Conditional

> "You have 30 days to try everything with no questions asked. If it's not for you, full refund.
> 
> PLUS: If you complete all modules and don't get [result] in 90 days, we'll refund double your investment."

### Example Stack 2: Timeline + Outcome

> "You'll make $10,000 within 60 days, OR we keep working with you free until you do.
> 
> You'll make $30,000 within 90 days, OR same deal."

## Naming Your Guarantee

### Weak Names

- "100% Guarantee"

### Strong Names

| "Triple Protection Guarantee" | Implies multiple layers |

## Common Objections

### "Won't people take advantage?"

**Answer:** Some will. The math still works. 23% more net sales with doubled refunds.

### "I can't afford refunds"

**Answer:** Use conditional guarantees. Require proof of effort. You control who qualifies.

### "What if I can't deliver?"

**Answer:** Then you have a product problem, not a guarantee problem. Fix the product.

### "My industry doesn't do guarantees"

**Answer:** Exactly why you should. Differentiation = competitive advantage.

---

## The Bottom Line

> "The best guarantee is one where:
> 1. Customers feel zero risk
> 2. You're protected from abuse
> 3. It differentiates your offer
> 4. It's easy to understand
> 5. You can actually deliver on it"

Start with a service guarantee. Track everything. Let the math prove it works.
