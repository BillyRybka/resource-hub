# Complete Example: Weight Loss Grand Slam Offer

From Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers book (Chapters 8-9, 14-15). This is the most detailed example in the book, showing every step of the transformation.

<overview>

**Before:** $99/month bootcamp membership nobody would buy ("LA Fitness is $29/mo")

**After:** $599-$5,200 offer people eagerly purchased (2 refunds out of 4,000+ sales)

</overview>

<dream_outcome>

**The shift:** Sell the destination, not the vehicle.

| Before (Process) | After (Destination) |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "6-week fitness program" | "Lose 20lbs in 6 weeks" |
| "Bootcamp membership" | "Get the body your spouse can't keep their hands off" |

**Final Dream Outcome:** "Lose 20lbs in 6 weeks"
- Specific (20lbs)
- Time-bound (6 weeks)
- Visceral (they can feel wanting it)
- Status-enhancing (others will notice)

<guarantee>

**Hormozi's exact script (Chapter 14):**

> "Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did? Now I'm not guaranteeing you're going to hit this goal in six weeks, after all, because I can't eat the food for you. But I am guaranteeing that you will get $500 worth of value and service from us to support you. If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I'll write you a check the day you tell me we suck."

**The close:**

> "Best case you get the body of your dreams and we give you all your money towards staying with us to hit your long-term goal. Worst case you tell me I suck, I write you a check, and you get six weeks of free training. Both options are risk free. But, the only thing guaranteed not to help you is walking out of here today."

**Result:** 2 refunds out of 4,000+ sales in 3.5 years.

</guarantee>
