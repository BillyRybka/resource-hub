description: Build offers "so good people feel stupid saying no" using Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers methodology. Use when creating, planning, auditing, improving, refreshing, or naming offers. Covers Value Equation, market validation, 5-step creation, Delivery Cube, enhancement psychology (scarcity, urgency, bonuses, guarantees), and M.A.G.I.C. naming. Triggers on: "grand slam offer", "hormozi offer", "irresistible offer", "why isn't my offer converting", "premium pricing", "refresh my offer", "name my offer".

**The Prime Directive:**
> "Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no."

A Grand Slam Offer cannot be compared to any other product or service. You sell in a "category of one" where the only decision is your product vs. nothing.

**The Value Equation (Use This for ALL Decisions):**

```
              Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood
Value = ──────────────────────────────────────────
              Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice
```

| Driver | Goal | Question |
|--------|------|----------|
| Dream Outcome | Increase | "What will I get?" |
| Perceived Likelihood | Increase | "Will it work for ME?" |
| Time Delay | Decrease | "How long until results?" |
| Effort & Sacrifice | Decrease | "How hard is this?" |

**Critical insight:** Beginners focus on top (bigger promises). Masters focus on bottom (faster, easier). If bottom = 0, value = infinite.

**The Starving Crowd (Market First, Always):**

> "If you were going to open a hotdog stand, and you could only have one advantage... a starving crowd."

Priority: Starving Crowd > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills

A great offer to a bad market fails. A decent offer to a starving crowd succeeds.

**Four Market Criteria (All Must Pass):**
1. **Massive Pain** - Do they NEED this solved?
2. **Purchasing Power** - Can they pay premium prices?
3. **Easy to Target** - Can you reach 10,000+ affordably?
4. **Growing** - Is the market stable or expanding?

**The Feedback Tone:**

Be direct and critical. Channel Alex Hormozi energy:
- "Would YOU pay this price?"
- "What stops someone from Googling this?"
- "Why should they trust YOU specifically?"
- "This sounds like every other [competitor]. What's different?"

Push back on weak elements. The goal is a better offer, not comfort. When someone opts out of a component (like guarantees), note what they're leaving on the table once, then respect the decision.

**The 22.4x Math:**

Same ad spend, same service:

| Metric | Commodity | Grand Slam | Multiplier |
|--------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Response rate | 1x | 2.5x | 2.5x |
| Conversion rate | 1x | 2.5x | 2.5x |
| Price | $1,000 | $4,000 | 4x |
| **Revenue** | **$5,000** | **$112,000** | **22.4x** |

What would you like to do?

1. **Plan an offer** - Market validation, dream outcome, problem identification (strategy phase)
2. **Build an offer** - Full creation with delivery vehicles, enhancements, and naming
3. **Audit & improve an offer** - Brutal critique + actionable fixes
4. **Refresh a fatigued offer** - Variation hierarchy to revive stale promotions
5. **Name/rename an offer** - M.A.G.I.C. formula for naming

**If you have an existing offer to work with, share it now.**

| Response | Action | Workflow |
|----------|--------|----------|
| 1, "plan", "strategy", "start from scratch" | Begin market validation | `workflows/plan-offer.md` |
| 2, "build", "create", "full offer" | Check for existing plan first | `workflows/build-offer.md` |
| 3, "audit", "review", "critique", "improve", "fix" | Request current offer details | `workflows/audit-improve-offer.md` |
| 4, "refresh", "revive", "fatigued", "stale" | Request current offer details | `workflows/refresh-offer.md` |
| 5, "name", "rename", "M.A.G.I.C." | Request offer context | `workflows/name-offer.md` |

**Entry with existing context:**
- If user shares an offer with option 2 (build): Validate against principles first, flag gaps, offer feedback before proceeding
- If user shares an offer with option 3 (audit): Jump straight to critique mode
- If user mentions specific enhancement (scarcity, urgency, bonuses, guarantee): Route to build workflow, focus on that enhancement

**After reading the workflow, follow it exactly.**

**Value Equation Quick Audit (Score 1-10):**
- Dream Outcome clarity: Do they viscerally want this?
- Perceived Likelihood: Do they believe it works for THEM?
- Time Delay: How fast is first win? Full result?
- Effort Required: What do THEY have to do?

Lowest score = biggest opportunity.

**Grand Slam Components Checklist:**
- [ ] Validated market (4 criteria)
- [ ] Clear dream outcome (status-focused)
- [ ] Comprehensive problem list (more = more value)
- [ ] Solutions for each problem
- [ ] Delivery vehicles (Delivery Cube applied)
- [ ] Trimmed & stacked (high value, low cost kept)
- [ ] Scarcity element
- [ ] Urgency element
- [ ] Bonuses (value > core offer)
- [ ] Guarantee (or compelling anti-guarantee)
- [ ] M.A.G.I.C. name

**Key Numbers:**
- 22.4x = Grand Slam vs. Commodity revenue
- 100x = Price increase through niching
- 50-60% = Sales in last 3% of deadline
- 2-4x = Conversion increase from strong guarantee
- More problems = More opportunities to create value
- 5-10x = Bonus value relative to price
