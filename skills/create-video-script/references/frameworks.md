# Frameworks

Organize complex information into structured, easy-to-understand formats.

## Three Types of Frameworks

### 1. Acronyms

Create memorable words where each letter represents a key concept.

**How to Create an Acronym:**
1. Break down what you want to teach into core components
2. List the first letter of each component (e.g., T-R-T-T)
3. Rearrange or reword components to spell something memorable
4. Consider using AI tools to help generate options

**Benefits:**
- Simplify complex ideas down to a few letters
- Enhanced memory retention
- More actionable and shareable

**Implementation:**
- Use acronyms to explain a single point within your video
- OR structure your entire video around each letter
- For full-video approaches, each letter becomes a content brick with its own example and application sections

### 2. Conceptual Frameworks

Simplify complex ideas into easily understood analogies.

**Examples:**
- Sales funnels
- Ladders (progression)
- Trees (branching concepts)
- Bridges
- Targets

Similar to metaphors but often organize multiple concepts into a cohesive system.

**Development process:** Ask "what else is like the thing I want to show?"

While potentially the most challenging to create, they can be extremely memorable and effective when done well.

### 3. Process Frameworks

Break down complex tasks into clear, sequential steps.

**How to Create:**
1. Break the task into steps
2. Eliminate any non-critical steps
3. Visually map the process through diagrams or simple illustrations

While less creative than other frameworks, they're highly effective for practical instruction.

## Implementation Flexibility

Any framework can be used to:
- **Make a single point:** The framework appears in your example section
- **Structure an entire video:** Each component becomes its own content brick

## Critical Warning

> "Although I personally have witnessed success with very creative and surreal metaphors and story, I don't actually recommend that you do that... copying exactly what I've done in the past... might be the exact opposite of what your audience likes."

While the fundamental principles of "Show Don't Tell" are timeless, specific implementation should be tailored to your unique audience.

**The best approach is "ready, fire, aim":**
- Test different frameworks with your audience
- Discover what resonates with them
- Refine based on results

> "The foundations of show, don't tell, have never changed... But the way you use them and the level you take them to is different for every creator."
