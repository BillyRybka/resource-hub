# End Brick

YouTube videos never end. They set up another problem and point to the solution.

> "YouTube videos never end. They just simply set up another problem the viewers have and then say, 'Watch this video next to solve it.'"

## The End Brick Formula

1. **Transition** from your final point to your end screen call to action
2. **Poke a new problem** that viewers might face after implementing your advice
3. **Promise a solution** in another specific video

## Example End Brick

> "The thing is, now you know how to reduce the rash, you've got to make sure you stop getting it in the first place because it will come back. So watch this video next and I'll teach you how to do just that."

---

## The Hidden Message

This approach communicates:

> "Now I've shown you how to solve the problem you clicked on. But there's another related problem that, if you don't fix it, means everything I've just shown you probably won't work. So watch this video next to learn how to stop that from wrecking your life."

## The Business Impact

This technique can dramatically increase end screen click-through rates.

Example: CTR jumped from 0.9% to 20-25% after implementing this approach.

---

## Why It Works

The End Brick leverages the same setup-payoff dynamic that powers the rest of your video, but extends it across your content.

When you set up an intriguing problem and promise a solution in another video, viewers click to satisfy their curiosity - creating "binge sessions."

---

## Implementation Keys

1. The new problem should be **related to the topic** of the current video
2. The stakes should be **clear** (why this new problem matters)
3. The promised solution should feel **valuable and specific**
4. Direct viewers to a **specific video**, not just your channel
5. Place this call to action **over your end screen element**

---

## What NOT to Do

- Don't summarize your video (signals ending, viewers leave)
- Don't just say "subscribe and like"
- Don't send them to a generic "watch more" screen
- Don't forget to actually create the setup-payoff dynamic

The End Brick completes the circle of engagement, transforming individual videos into a continuous viewing journey.
