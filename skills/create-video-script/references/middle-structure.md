# Middle Structure

The middle section delivers on your intro's promises.

## The AIE Formula

Your middle section should be:
- **Actionable:** Gives viewers concrete steps they can implement
- **Informative:** Teaches viewers something new and valuable
- **Entertaining:** Keeps viewers engaged throughout

## The Building Block Structure

The middle consists of "points" or information blocks. Each point becomes a "brick" in your content structure.

### Each Brick Follows This Pattern:

1. Transition from intro/previous point
2. Example brick
3. Transition to application
4. Application brick
5. Transition to next point (if applicable)

---

## Element 1: Transitions Between Points

Every transition should clearly explain **why the upcoming information matters**.

After your intro, transition to your first point with:
> "To start, let me show you how to [insert what you'll demonstrate] that will [insert benefit or problem it solves]."

Example: "To start, let me show you how to make game-changing thumbnails that will 10X your views."

Without this transition, viewers won't understand why they should care and may become frustrated.

---

## Element 2: The Example Brick

The example brick is where you:
- Simplify complex information
- Make viewers feel confident they can achieve the result
- Create an entertaining section that doesn't feel like "learning"

This section builds confidence through concrete examples rather than abstract concepts.

See: `references/example-brick-overview.md`

## Element 3: Transition to Application

After your example, transition by stating what you'll show and why it matters:

> "Now I'm going to show you how to do this yourself. Here's why it's critical..."

This maintains curiosity and clearly signals you're moving from concept to implementation.

---

## Element 4: The Application Brick

Provides actionable steps viewers can take:
- Could be one step or many steps
- Focuses on practical implementation
- Gives viewers something to try that will yield results

When viewers apply your teaching and get results, they gain trust and become loyal fans.

See: `references/application-brick.md`

## Maintaining the AIE Formula

This structure ensures all three criteria:
- The example section makes content **entertaining**
- The application section makes content **actionable**
- Both sections together make content **informative**

---

## Length Considerations

The length of each section can vary:
- Examples could be brief or extensive
- Transitions should always be concise
- Application sections should include enough detail for successful implementation

What matters most: each section serves a clear purpose and avoids "pointless waffle."
