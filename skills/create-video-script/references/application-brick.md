# Application Brick

Transform inspiration into practical steps. This builds goodwill and cements your value.

## Step 1: Create a Smooth Transition

Like cement between bricks, you need a transition from your Example to Application.

**Effective transition phrases:**
- "But how do you do this for yourself?"
- "Next, let me break down how you can apply this step by step"
- "Let me show you exactly how to implement this in your own life"

These prime viewers to stay engaged because valuable, applicable content is coming.

## Step 2: Make it BES (Big, Easy, Specific)

Many creators fail by making advice either too vague or too complex.

Hit the sweet spot:

| Quality | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Big** | Steps feel significant and will make a meaningful difference |
| **Easy** | Accessible enough that viewers feel confident implementing |
| **Specific** | Clear enough that anyone could follow without confusion |

**Poor example:**
> "To make money, you just need to learn Python."

This leaves viewers with questions: Where do I start? How do I do it? What's the best approach?

## Step 3: Break Down Complex Tasks

> "You wouldn't eat a giant loaf of bread like an apple... instead, you'd cut it up into slices."

Same principle for teaching:
- Slice big tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- For each step, ask: "How can I make this so clear that even my grandmother could follow it?"
- Use numbered steps or frameworks to organize
- Continue using "Show Don't Tell" techniques when possible

---

## Step 4: Match Content to Audience Level ("Matchy-Matchy")

Adjust depth and complexity based on your audience:
- **Beginners** need simple steps and frameworks
- **Experts** might appreciate more detailed insights and nuances

**Critical insight:** Because you're likely an expert in your field, you've probably forgotten how little beginners know. Even when targeting experts, it's usually better to err on the side of simplicity.

## Step 5: Continue to Show, Don't Just Tell

The power of visual demonstration doesn't end in the Example Brick.

When providing actionable steps:
- Continue looking for opportunities to show rather than just tell
- Ask: "Is there any way I can demonstrate this step rather than just explaining it?"
- Keep the tone consistent with your Example Brick

> "The more you showy, the more you'll growy"

---

## Step 6: Transition to Next Section

Once you've completed your application advice:
- **Don't summarize** (this signals an ending)
- Instead, set up a new problem that your next section will solve
- Keep the curiosity loop open

---

## Length and Success Criteria

No set length requirement:
- Can be brief in some sections, extensive in others
- Focus on making content actionable, not hitting a specific length
- Ensure advice meets the AIE criteria (Actionable, Informative, Entertaining)

**The ultimate test:**
> "If viewers implemented what you've shown them, would they actually get a result?"

Even small wins build credibility and create fans.
