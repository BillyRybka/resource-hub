# Introduction Structure

Your introduction determines whether viewers stay or leave. Keep it **under 15 seconds**.

## Three Objectives

1. Raise curiosity quickly so viewers want to continue
2. Establish your credibility on the topic
3. Ensure viewers don't feel clickbaited by your thumbnail/title

---

## Step 1: Identify Viewer Questions

Examine your thumbnail and title. Ask: "What three questions will people want answers to when they see this?"

Examples:
- What's the trick?
- Why should I do this?
- How will this help my business?

These questions guide your entire intro structure.

## Step 2: Create a Powerful Hook

The hook captures attention in the first 5 seconds. Effective hooks:
- Are kept as short as possible
- Create curiosity
- Relate to your packaging or viewer's problem

### Four Proven Hook Types

**Question Hook:**
"Have you ever felt like your partner might be cheating on you?"
- Directly addresses viewer problems
- Including "you" makes people pay more attention

**Fact Hook:**
"66% of entrepreneurs will never start a business because they're too scared of failing."
- Uses surprising statistics
- Creates a "What? No way!" reaction

**Statement Hook:**
"I'm a multimillionaire and I don't own my house and I don't invest in any property."
- Makes a bold, surprising statement
- Requires confident delivery

**Credibility Hook:**
"I've been in business for 13 years. I've sold nine companies. My last company I sold for $46.2 million."
- Establishes authority immediately
- Works when achievements are significant enough

## Step 3: Add a Seamless Transition

Connect your hook to your setup. Three approaches:

**Poke the Problem:**
"Every YouTuber I know hates making thumbnails. The thing is, they're the most important part of your video because if you don't get a click, nobody watches and all that time goes to waste."

**Tease the Result:**
"I used to hate thumbnails until I found the simplest way to make viral thumbnails fast, and they generated me millions of views."

**Combo Transition:**
"Every YouTuber hates thumbnails because they take so long to make. The thing is, there's a special type of thumbnail style that's fast and easy to produce and it's blowing up channels right now."

## Step 4: Craft Your Setup

The setup provides an overview of your video's value:
- Get viewers excited about what's coming
- Continue building curiosity
- Confirm the value they're expecting

Address the three questions you identified:
"In this video, I'm going to show you what this game-changing thumbnail trick is, why it's critical you make boring thumbnails now, and how to use it to explode your sales."

**Limit to 3 points maximum** to maintain attention.

## Step 5: Insert a Credibility Element

Stand out by establishing authority:
- How long you've been an expert
- How many people you've helped
- Results you've achieved
- Extensive research you've done

Integrate naturally into your hook, transition, or setup - not as a standalone section.

---

## Step 6: Transition to First Point

Connect your intro to your first main point:

"To start, let me show you how to make game-changing thumbnails that 10x your views."

**Always use "let me show you"** - not "let's talk," "let's dive in," or "let's discuss." Viewers come to YouTube to see, not just hear.
