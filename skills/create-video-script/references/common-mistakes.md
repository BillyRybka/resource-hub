# Common Script-Killing Mistakes

Avoid these anti-patterns that wreck viewer retention and engagement.

## Tension-Release Mistakes

### 1. Paying Off Too Early
Revealing your payoff before building sufficient tension kills curiosity and causes viewers to leave.

**Bad example:**
> "Ever wondered why your team never listens to you? It's because you're giving them instructions instead of writing down clear ones they can reference at any time."

The early reveal eliminates the need to continue watching.

### 2. Breaking Trust with Unfulfilled Setups
Setting something up but never delivering the payoff frustrates viewers and damages credibility. This "internal clickbait" is often accidental but has the same negative effect.

**Prevention tip:** Color-code setups in your script and systematically check that each one has been properly paid off.

## Introduction Mistakes

### 3. Weak or Missing Hook
If you don't create curiosity in the first 5 seconds, viewers leave immediately.

### 4. Intro Too Long
Keep it under 15 seconds. Every second over increases drop-off.

### 5. Using "Let's talk about" Instead of "Let me show you"
Viewers come to YouTube to see, not just hear. "Let me show you" creates anticipation.

## Content Mistakes

### 6. Making Advice Too Vague
> "To make money, just learn Python."

Leaves viewers confused with no clear next step.

### 7. Making Advice Too Complex
Overwhelming viewers with complexity makes them feel stupid and leave.

### 8. Telling Stories AFTER Explaining Points
Stories should come before or during explanations, never after you've already delivered the information. Doing it backwards ruins the reveal.

### 9. Dragging Stories Out
Remove any details that don't directly impact the story's conclusion. Every unnecessary detail is a chance for viewers to leave.

## Example Brick Mistakes

### 10. Forcing Techniques Where They Don't Fit
Not every video needs every technique. Choose the tool that best communicates your specific point.

### 11. Using Overused Examples
Third-party stories using Apple, Elon Musk, etc. that viewers have heard repeatedly. Find unique, lesser-known stories.

### 12. Executing Fictional Stories Poorly
Most creators make fictional stories feel childish or awkward. If you can't do it well, use other story types.

## Application Brick Mistakes

### 13. Failing the BES Test
Steps that aren't Big, Easy, and Specific leave viewers without actionable takeaways.

### 14. Forgetting Audience Level
As an expert, you've forgotten how little beginners know. Err on the side of simplicity.

### 15. Stopping "Show Don't Tell"
The visual demonstration shouldn't end after the Example Brick. Continue showing in Application.

## End Brick Mistakes

### 16. Summarizing Your Video
Summarizing signals "it's over" and viewers leave before your CTA.

### 17. Rushing Off After Final Point
Just saying "that's it, see ya!" is the cardinal sin. Set up the next problem instead.

### 18. Generic CTAs
"Subscribe and like" or sending to a generic channel page doesn't create curiosity.

## Mindset Mistakes

### 19. Expecting Immediate Results
These techniques require practice and refinement. Think long-term.

### 20. Copying Exactly What Others Do
Your audience may respond differently. Test what resonates with YOUR viewers.
