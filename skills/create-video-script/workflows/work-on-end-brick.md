## Step 1: Get Context

Ask the user:
1. What was the video about?
2. What did viewers just learn?
3. What's the last content brick about?
4. Do you have other videos to point to?

**Output:** Context established.

---

## Step 2: Transition from Final Point

Bridge from your last content brick. This should flow naturally, not feel like an abrupt ending.

**Do NOT:**
- Summarize what they learned
- Say "that's it" or "that's a wrap"
- Use generic closing language
- Signal that the video is ending

**Draft transition:**
> [Write bridge sentence here]

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Flows naturally from final point
- [ ] No summary language
- [ ] No "ending" signals

**Output:** Transition drafted.

## Step 3: Identify Related Problem

What challenge might viewers face AFTER implementing what you taught?

**Brainstorm:**
- After they do [what you taught], they might struggle with ___
- The next logical challenge is ___
- If they don't also fix ___, what I taught won't work
- A common follow-up question would be ___
- The next step in their journey is ___

**Key insight:** The new problem must be RELATED to the current video topic.

**Selected problem:**
> [The related problem viewers will face]

**Why this problem:**
> [Why it's relevant to viewers who just watched this video]

**Output:** New problem identified.

---

## Step 4: Establish Stakes

Make clear why this new problem is important. What happens if they don't solve it?

**Template:**
> "The thing is, now you know how to [what you taught], you've got to make sure [the new problem], because if you don't, [consequence]."

**Consequence options:**
- Everything I taught won't work
- You'll be back where you started
- You'll waste all that effort
- The problem will come back
- You won't get the full result

**Draft stakes:**
> [Why solving this new problem matters]

**Output:** Stakes established.

---

## Step 5: Select Specific Next Video

**Critical:** Do NOT send to generic channel page. Point to a SPECIFIC video.

**Which video solves this new problem?**

**Video title:** [Exact title]

**What they'll learn:** [The solution to the new problem]

**Why this video:** [How it connects to the problem you poked]

If you don't have an existing video:
- [ ] Create this video next (planned content)
- [ ] Point to most relevant existing video
- [ ] Consider creating a video specifically for this purpose

**Output:** Specific video selected.

---

## Step 6: Write the CTA

**Template:**
> "So watch this video next and I'll show you [what they'll learn that solves the new problem]."

**Draft CTA:**
> [Write your call to action]

**CTA checklist:**
- [ ] Uses "watch this video next" or similar
- [ ] Promises specific solution
- [ ] Creates curiosity about the next video
- [ ] NOT "subscribe and like"
- [ ] NOT "check out my channel"

**Output:** CTA drafted.

---

## Step 7: Assemble Complete End Brick

Put all pieces together:

> [Transition from final point]
>
> [New problem with stakes]
>
> [Specific next video CTA]

**Example for reference:**
> "The thing is, now you know how to reduce the rash, you've got to make sure you stop getting it in the first place because it will come back. So watch this video next and I'll teach you how to do just that."

**Your complete End Brick:**
> [Write complete end brick here]

**Output:** End Brick assembled.

---

## Step 8: End Screen Planning

The end screen element should appear during your CTA.

**Timing considerations:**
- End screens can be up to 20 seconds
- Your CTA should align with when the clickable element appears
- Practice the timing to ensure CTA and visual match

**End screen element:**
- [ ] Video card pointing to specific video
- [ ] Positioned where you'll direct attention
- [ ] Timing aligned with CTA delivery

**Placement note:** [Where and when the end screen appears]

**Output:** End screen planned.

---

## Step 9: Final Verification

**End Brick Checklist:**

- [ ] No summary of video content
- [ ] No "that's it" or closing language
- [ ] Flows naturally from final point
- [ ] New problem is RELATED to current video
- [ ] Stakes are clear (consequence of not solving)
- [ ] Points to SPECIFIC video, not generic
- [ ] CTA uses "watch this video next" language
- [ ] End screen element planned

**The Hidden Message Test:**

Does your End Brick communicate:
> "Now I've shown you how to solve the problem you clicked on. But there's another related problem that, if you don't fix it, means everything I've just shown you probably won't work. So watch this video next."

- [ ] Yes → End Brick complete
- [ ] No → Revise to strengthen the connection

**Output:** Complete End Brick ready.
