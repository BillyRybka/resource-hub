## Step 1: Choose Your Tool

Ask the user what they're trying to accomplish:

| If You Need To... | Use |
|-------------------|-----|
| Build credibility through your experience | Story (Personal) |
| Show you can help others succeed | Story (Client) |
| Provide engaging third-party proof | Story (Third-Party) |
| Make abstract concept concrete | Metaphor |
| Add visual demonstration | Metaphor with Physical Prop |
| Organize complex multi-part info | Framework (Acronym) |
| Create visual model | Framework (Conceptual) |
| Show sequential steps | Framework (Process) |

**Selected tool:** [ ] Story  [ ] Metaphor  [ ] Framework

---

## Path A: Story

### Step A1: Select Story Type

| Type | Rating | When to Use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| [ ] Personal Experience | 10/10 | You overcame this challenge yourself |
| [ ] Client/Student Success | 10/10 | You helped someone else succeed |
| [ ] Third-Party | 8/10 | Found unique example (avoid overused ones) |
| [ ] Fictional | 7/10 | Only if you can execute well |

**Selected type:** ___

### Step A2: Beginning (Who + Problem + Why)

**Who:** [Name - real or specific composite]

**Problem:** [The problem they faced]

**Why:** [Why solving this was crucial - creates stakes]

**One sentence that captures all three:**
> [Draft sentence]

### Step A3: Middle (Conflict + How Overcome)

**Conflict/Obstacle:** [What got in the way?]

**How Overcome:** [This is where the lesson lives]

> [Draft the journey - only essential details]

**Detail check:**
- [ ] Each detail impacts the ending
- [ ] No unnecessary information
- [ ] Keeps viewer engaged

### Step A4: End (Resolution + Lesson)

**Resolution:** What happened?
- [ ] Got what they wanted AND needed (happy ending)
- [ ] Got what they wanted but NOT what they needed
- [ ] Got what they needed but NOT what they wanted
- [ ] Got neither (tragedy)

**Lesson:** What this proves about your point

> [Draft the payoff]

### Step A5: Story Verification

- [ ] Story comes BEFORE explanation (not after)
- [ ] Specific details (names, numbers, timeframes)
- [ ] Clear connection to the point
- [ ] Relatable situation
- [ ] Concrete consequence
- [ ] Viewers won't realize it's a "story" when well-executed

**Output:** Story complete.

## Path B: Metaphor

### Step B1: Define the Problem

- **What is the problem?** [Answer]
- **How does it make people feel?** [Answer]
- **Characteristic features:** [List]

### Step B2: Define the Solution

- **What is the solution?** [Answer]
- **What feelings/outcomes does it provide?** [Answer]
- **Steps or characteristics:** [List]

### Step B3: Identify Core Analogy

**Problem is like:** [Something with similar characteristics]
- Examples: storm, maze, broken machine, uphill climb

**Solution is like:** [Something that embodies the outcome]
- Examples: key, compass, bridge, roadmap

### Step B4: Create the Metaphor

**Remember:** A metaphor says X IS Y, not X is LIKE Y.

**Draft metaphor:**
> "[X] is [Y]..."

**Expand into full statement:**
> [Complete metaphorical statement with details]

### Step B5: Physical Prop (Optional)

Can you demonstrate this with a physical prop?

**Prop ideas:**
- Glasses of water (for allocation/division)
- Chain (for interconnected systems)
- Stacking blocks (for building concepts)
- Physical items that represent abstract concepts

**Prop:** [What you'll use]
**How to use it:** [Description of visual demonstration]

### Step B6: Metaphor Verification

- [ ] Uses universally understood concept
- [ ] Specific but not overly complex
- [ ] Works as "X IS Y"
- [ ] Has clear transition in and out
- [ ] Physical prop enhances (if applicable)

**Output:** Metaphor complete.

## Path C: Framework

### Step C1: Choose Framework Type

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| [ ] **Acronym** | Memorable letters representing key concepts |
| [ ] **Conceptual** | Visual model (funnel, ladder, tree, bridge, target) |
| [ ] **Process** | Sequential steps in clear order |

**Selected type:** ___

### Step C2A: Acronym Framework

**Core concepts to teach:** [List them]

**First letters:** [X-X-X-X]

**Rearranged to spell:** [Memorable word]

**Breakdown:**
- **[Letter 1]:** [Concept] - [Brief explanation]
- **[Letter 2]:** [Concept] - [Brief explanation]
- **[Letter 3]:** [Concept] - [Brief explanation]
- **[Letter 4]:** [Concept] - [Brief explanation]

**Tip:** Use AI tools to help generate memorable arrangements.

### Step C2B: Conceptual Framework

**Visual model:** [ ] Funnel  [ ] Ladder  [ ] Tree  [ ] Bridge  [ ] Target  [ ] Other: ___

**How it maps:**
- [Part 1 of visual] = [Concept 1]
- [Part 2 of visual] = [Concept 2]
- [Part 3 of visual] = [Concept 3]

**Description for viewers:**
> [How to explain this visual]

### Step C2C: Process Framework

**Steps (essential only):**
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Visual mapping:** [How to show this - diagram, on-screen text, etc.]

### Step C3: Framework Verification

- [ ] Organizes complex information clearly
- [ ] Easy to remember
- [ ] Each component is essential (no filler)
- [ ] Can work for single point or entire video structure

**Output:** Framework complete.
