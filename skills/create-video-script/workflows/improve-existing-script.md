# Workflow: Improve Existing Script

Fill gaps and strengthen weak sections in an existing script.

<required_reading>
Before starting, read:
- references/common-mistakes.md (what to look for)
- references/tension-release-framework.md (core pattern)
</required_reading>

<process>

## Step 1: Get the Current Script

Ask the user to share:
- The existing script (or location)
- What they feel is weak or missing
- What's working well (if known)

**Output:** Script loaded, user concerns noted.

---

## Step 2: Structure Audit

Check if all required sections exist:

| Section | Present? | Quality |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Introduction | [ ] | [1-5] |
| Hook | [ ] | [1-5] |
| Setup (max 3 points) | [ ] | [1-5] |
| Credibility element | [ ] | [1-5] |
| Content Bricks | [ ] | [1-5] |
| Example Bricks | [ ] | [1-5] |
| Application Bricks | [ ] | [1-5] |
| End Brick | [ ] | [1-5] |

**Output:** Structure gaps identified.

---

## Step 3: Tension-Release Audit

Map out the setups and payoffs:

| Setup | Location | Payoff Location | Paid Off? |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| [Setup 1] | [Where] | [Where] | [ ] |
| [Setup 2] | [Where] | [Where] | [ ] |
| [Setup 3] | [Where] | [Where] | [ ] |

Check for:
- [ ] Setups without payoffs (internal clickbait)
- [ ] Payoffs that come too early
- [ ] Sections without any setup (boring)

**Output:** Tension-release problems identified.

---

## Step 4: Common Mistakes Scan

Check against references/common-mistakes.md:

**Introduction:**
- [ ] Hook creates curiosity?
- [ ] Under 15 seconds?
- [ ] Uses "let me show you" not "let's talk"?

**Content:**
- [ ] Stories come BEFORE explanations?
- [ ] Advice is BES (not vague or complex)?
- [ ] Example bricks show, don't tell?

**Ending:**
- [ ] No summary that signals "it's over"?
- [ ] End brick sets up new problem?
- [ ] Points to specific video?

**Output:** Specific mistakes identified.

---

## Step 5: Prioritize Fixes

Rank issues by impact:

| Issue | Impact (1-5) | Effort (1-5) | Priority |
|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| [Issue 1] | | | |
| [Issue 2] | | | |
| [Issue 3] | | | |

Focus on high-impact, low-effort fixes first.

**Output:** Prioritized fix list.

---

## Step 6: Work Through Each Fix

For each priority issue, apply the relevant fix:

**If Introduction weak:**
→ Use templates/introduction-template.md
→ See workflows/work-on-introduction.md

**If Example Brick weak:**
→ Use templates/example-brick-template.md
→ See workflows/work-on-example-brick.md

**If Application Brick weak:**
→ Use templates/application-brick-template.md
→ See workflows/work-on-application-brick.md

**If End Brick weak:**
→ Use templates/end-brick-template.md
→ See workflows/work-on-end-brick.md

**Output:** Each issue fixed.

---

## Step 7: Voice Consistency Check

Use `brand-voice` skill to verify:
- Consistent voice throughout (including new sections)
- New content matches existing style
- No jarring transitions between old and new

**Output:** Voice verified.

---

## Step 8: Final Tension-Release Verification

Re-run the tension-release audit from Step 3:
- [ ] All setups now have payoffs
- [ ] No payoffs come too early
- [ ] Curiosity maintained throughout
- [ ] End brick creates final setup

**Output:** Improved script verified.

</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] All structural gaps filled
- [ ] Tension-release pattern fixed
- [ ] Common mistakes eliminated
- [ ] Voice consistent throughout
- [ ] User's specific concerns addressed
- [ ] Script now passes full audit checklist
</success_criteria>
