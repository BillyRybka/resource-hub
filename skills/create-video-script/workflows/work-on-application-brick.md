## Step 1: Get Context

Ask the user:
1. What did the Example Brick demonstrate?
2. What should viewers be able to DO after this section?
3. What's the audience level? (Beginner/Intermediate/Expert)

**Output:** Context established.

---

## Step 2: Write Transition from Example

Signal that actionable advice is coming.

**Template options:**
- "But how do you do this for yourself?"
- "Next, let me break down how you can apply this step by step."
- "Let me show you exactly how to implement this."
- "Now I'm going to show you how to do this yourself. Here's why it's critical..."

**Draft transition:**
> [Write transition here]

**Output:** Transition drafted.

---

## Step 3: List Initial Steps

Write out the steps viewers need to take.

Don't worry about BES yet - just get the steps down:

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
4. [Step 4 if needed]
5. [Step 5 if needed]

**Output:** Raw steps listed.

## Step 4: Apply BES Check

For each step, verify it passes all three criteria:

### Step 1: [Step Name]

**Current version:** [The step as written]

**Big Check:** Will this make a meaningful difference?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No → Why should they bother? Add significance.

**Easy Check:** Can viewers confidently implement this?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No → Too complex. Break it down or simplify.

**Specific Check:** Could anyone follow this without confusion?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No → Add specific details. Remove ambiguity.

**Revised version:** [Improved step]

---

### Step 2: [Step Name]

**Current version:** [The step as written]

**Big Check:** [ ] Yes  [ ] No → [Fix]
**Easy Check:** [ ] Yes  [ ] No → [Fix]
**Specific Check:** [ ] Yes  [ ] No → [Fix]

**Revised version:** [Improved step]

---

### Step 3: [Step Name]

**Current version:** [The step as written]

**Big Check:** [ ] Yes  [ ] No → [Fix]
**Easy Check:** [ ] Yes  [ ] No → [Fix]
**Specific Check:** [ ] Yes  [ ] No → [Fix]

**Revised version:** [Improved step]

---

[Continue for additional steps]

**Output:** All steps pass BES.

---

## Step 5: Slice Complex Steps

If any step still feels too big, break it down.

**The bread analogy:** You wouldn't eat a loaf like an apple - you slice it.

**Complex step:** [The step that needs slicing]

**Sliced into:**
1. [Sub-step 1]
2. [Sub-step 2]
3. [Sub-step 3]

**Grandmother Test:** Could your grandmother follow these instructions?
- [ ] Yes → Good to go
- [ ] No → Slice further

**Output:** All steps appropriately sized.

---

## Step 6: Audience Level Check

**Target audience:** [ ] Beginner  [ ] Intermediate  [ ] Expert

**Matchy-Matchy verification:**

For Beginners:
- [ ] No assumed knowledge
- [ ] Extra explanation where needed
- [ ] Encouragement built in

For Intermediate:
- [ ] Some shortcuts OK
- [ ] Can reference common tools/concepts
- [ ] Focus on the "how" more than "what"

For Expert:
- [ ] Can use industry terminology
- [ ] Focus on nuances and optimization
- [ ] Still err on side of simplicity

**Adjustments needed:** [List any changes]

**Output:** Steps matched to audience.

---

## Step 7: Show Don't Tell Opportunities

For each step, ask: "Can I demonstrate this visually?"

| Step | Show Don't Tell Opportunity |
|------|----------------------------|
| 1 | [ ] Yes → [How?]  [ ] No |
| 2 | [ ] Yes → [How?]  [ ] No |
| 3 | [ ] Yes → [How?]  [ ] No |

**Potential demonstrations:**
- Screen recording of the action
- Physical demonstration
- Before/after visual
- Real tool or system shown
- Diagram or flowchart

**Output:** Visual opportunities identified.

---

## Step 8: Write Transition Out

Keep curiosity alive - DO NOT summarize!

**If going to next content brick:**
> [Set up why the next point matters]

**If going to end brick:**
> [Bridge to the new problem you'll poke]

**Draft transition:**
> [Write transition here]

**Critical check:**
- [ ] No summary of what they learned
- [ ] No "that's it" language
- [ ] Creates curiosity for what's next

**Output:** Transition out drafted.

---

## Step 9: Assemble Complete Application Brick

> [Transition from Example Brick]
>
> **Step 1:** [Specific, actionable step]
>
> **Step 2:** [Specific, actionable step]
>
> **Step 3:** [Specific, actionable step]
>
> [Transition to next section]

---

## Step 10: Ultimate Test

> "If viewers implemented what I've shown them, would they actually get a result?"

- [ ] Yes → Application Brick complete
- [ ] No → Revise steps to be more actionable

**Output:** Complete Application Brick ready.
