# Workflow: Work on Content Brick

Create or improve a single content brick (Example + Application).

<required_reading>
Before starting, read:
- references/middle-structure.md (brick pattern)
- references/example-brick-overview.md (show don't tell)
- references/application-brick.md (BES framework)
</required_reading>

<process>

## Step 1: Define the Point

Ask the user:
1. What is this content brick teaching?
2. What should viewers understand after this section?
3. Where does this brick fall in the video? (First/Middle/Last)

**Output:** Point defined.

---

## Step 2: Write Transition In

Explain why this point matters to the viewer.

**Template:**
> "To start/Next, let me show you how to [what you'll demonstrate] that will [benefit or problem solved]."

**Draft transition:**
> [Write transition here]

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Explains why this matters
- [ ] Uses "let me show you"
- [ ] Creates curiosity

**Output:** Transition in drafted.

---

## Step 3: Choose Example Brick Tool

**Selection guide:**

| If You Need To... | Use |
|-------------------|-----|
| Build credibility through experience | Story |
| Make abstract concept concrete | Metaphor |
| Organize complex multi-part information | Framework |

**Selected tool:** [ ] Story  [ ] Metaphor  [ ] Framework

**Output:** Tool selected.

---

## Step 4A: Create Story (if selected)

→ See workflows/work-on-example-brick.md for detailed story workflow

**Quick story structure:**

**Story type:** [ ] Personal (10/10)  [ ] Client (10/10)  [ ] Third-Party (8/10)  [ ] Fictional (7/10)

**Beginning (Who + Problem + Why):**
> [One sentence establishing all three]

**Middle (Conflict + How Overcome):**
> [The journey - only essential details]

**End (Resolution + Lesson):**
> [The payoff]

**Story checklist:**
- [ ] Comes BEFORE explanation
- [ ] Specific details (names, numbers, timeframes)
- [ ] No unnecessary details
- [ ] Clear connection to the point

**Output:** Story drafted.

---

## Step 4B: Create Metaphor (if selected)

→ See workflows/work-on-example-brick.md for detailed metaphor workflow

**5-step process:**

1. **Problem:** [What is it? How does it feel?]
2. **Solution:** [What is it? What outcome?]
3. **Analogy:** [Problem is like ___, Solution is like ___]
4. **Metaphor:** "[X] is [Y]..."
5. **Test:** [ ] Makes sense  [ ] Relatable

**Physical prop opportunity:** [If applicable]

**Output:** Metaphor drafted.

---

## Step 4C: Create Framework (if selected)

→ See workflows/work-on-example-brick.md for detailed framework workflow

**Framework type:** [ ] Acronym  [ ] Conceptual  [ ] Process

**If Acronym:**
- Letters: [X-X-X-X]
- Each letter means: [Breakdown]

**If Conceptual:**
- Visual model: [Funnel/Ladder/Tree/etc.]
- How it maps: [Explanation]

**If Process:**
- Steps: [1. 2. 3.]
- Visual: [How to show it]

**Output:** Framework drafted.

---

## Step 5: Write Transition to Application

Signal that practical advice is coming.

**Template options:**
- "But how do you do this for yourself?"
- "Now I'm going to show you how to do this yourself."
- "Let me show you exactly how to implement this."

**Draft transition:**
> [Write transition here]

**Output:** Transition to application drafted.

---

## Step 6: Create Application Brick

→ See workflows/work-on-application-brick.md for detailed workflow

**List your steps:**

| Step | Action | Big? | Easy? | Specific? |
|------|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | [Action] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 2 | [Action] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 3 | [Action] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

**Audience level check:**
- [ ] Matched to viewer knowledge level
- [ ] Erred on side of simplicity if unsure

**Show Don't Tell opportunities:**
- Step 1: [Can you demonstrate visually?]
- Step 2: [Can you demonstrate visually?]
- Step 3: [Can you demonstrate visually?]

**Output:** Application brick drafted.

---

## Step 7: Write Transition Out

Keep curiosity alive - DO NOT summarize!

**If going to next content brick:**
> [Set up why the next point matters]

**If going to end brick:**
> [Bridge to the new problem you'll poke]

**Draft transition:**
> [Write transition here]

**Critical check:**
- [ ] No summary of what they just learned
- [ ] Creates curiosity for what's next

**Output:** Transition out drafted.

---

## Step 8: Assemble Complete Brick

Put all pieces together:

> [Transition in]
>
> [Example Brick - Story/Metaphor/Framework]
>
> [Transition to application]
>
> [Application Brick - BES Steps]
>
> [Transition out]

**Output:** Complete content brick ready.
