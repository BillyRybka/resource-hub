# Workflow: Create New Script

Build a complete video script from scratch using the Tension-Release framework.

<required_reading>
Before starting, read:
- references/tension-release-framework.md (core philosophy)
- references/introduction-structure.md (under 15 seconds)
- references/middle-structure.md (AIE formula)
</required_reading>

<process>

## Step 1: Define the Video Goal

Ask the user:
1. What topic is this video about?
2. Who is the target audience? (What do they know/not know?)
3. What should viewers understand or be able to do after watching?

**Output:** One sentence describing the video goal.

---

## Step 2: Validate with Audience Avatar

Use the `audience-avatar` skill to check:
- Does this topic resonate with our target?
- What language would they use to describe this problem?
- What have they already tried?

**Output:** Confirmed audience fit and language notes.

---

## Step 3: Thumbnail/Title Concept

This is the FIRST setup in your content system.

Ask:
- What curiosity will the thumbnail create?
- What promise does the title make?

Remember: Pain converts better than pleasure.
- Weak: "How to [benefit]"
- Strong: "[Number] Mistakes [Audience] Make When [Topic]"

**Output:** Thumbnail/title concept that creates curiosity.

---

## Step 4: Identify Viewer Questions

From the thumbnail/title, what 3 questions will viewers want answered?

1. [Question about what]
2. [Question about why]
3. [Question about how]

These guide the entire intro structure.

**Output:** 3 viewer questions.

---

## Step 5: Create Introduction

Using templates/introduction-template.md, build:
1. Hook (choose type: Question/Fact/Statement/Credibility)
2. Transition (Poke Problem/Tease Result/Combo)
3. Setup (address the 3 questions, max 3 points)
4. Credibility element (integrated naturally)
5. Transition to first point ("let me show you...")

**Target:** Under 15 seconds total.

Use `brand-voice` skill to ensure voice consistency.

**Output:** Complete introduction script.

---

## Step 6: Plan Content Bricks

Determine the structure:
- How many main points will you cover?
- What tool will each Example Brick use? (Story/Metaphor/Framework)
- What order creates the best tension-release pattern?

Recommended: 2-4 content bricks for most videos.

**Output:** Content brick outline with tools selected.

---

## Step 7: Build Content Brick #1

Using templates/content-brick-template.md:

1. Write transition into this point
2. Create Example Brick (use templates/example-brick-template.md)
   - If Story: Follow 3-part structure, choose story type
   - If Metaphor: Use 5-step creation process
   - If Framework: Choose type (Acronym/Conceptual/Process)
3. Write transition to application
4. Create Application Brick (use templates/application-brick-template.md)
   - Apply BES check to each step
   - Match to audience level
5. Write transition to next point

**Output:** Complete Content Brick #1.

---

## Step 8: Build Remaining Content Bricks

Repeat Step 7 for each additional content brick.

For each brick:
- Ensure tension-release pattern continues
- Vary Example Brick tools if appropriate
- Maintain momentum toward end

**Output:** All content bricks complete.

---

## Step 9: Create End Brick

Using templates/end-brick-template.md:

1. Transition from final content brick
2. Poke a NEW related problem
3. Establish stakes (why this matters)
4. Point to SPECIFIC next video

**Critical:** Do NOT summarize. Do NOT say "that's it."

**Output:** Complete End Brick.

---

## Step 10: Voice Check and Compile

Use `brand-voice` skill to verify:
- Voice is consistent throughout
- Language matches brand standards

Compile everything into templates/video-script-outline.md.

Run final tension-release audit:
- [ ] Every setup has a matching payoff
- [ ] No payoffs before sufficient tension
- [ ] Curiosity maintained throughout

**Output:** Complete video script.
