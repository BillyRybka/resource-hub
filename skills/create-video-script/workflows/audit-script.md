## Step 1: Get the Script

Ask the user to share:
- The complete script
- Any specific areas of concern
- The target audience for this video

**Output:** Script loaded for review.

## Step 2: Structure Audit

### Introduction Check

| Element | Present | Quality (1-5) | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Hook | [ ] | | |
| Hook creates curiosity | [ ] | | |
| Transition | [ ] | | |
| Setup (3 points max) | [ ] | | |
| Credibility integrated | [ ] | | |
| First point transition | [ ] | | |
| Under 15 seconds | [ ] | | |
| Uses "let me show you" | [ ] | | |

### Content Bricks Check

For each content brick:

| Brick # | Transition In | Example Brick | Tool Used | Transition to App | Application Brick | BES Pass | Transition Out |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | [ ] | [ ] | Story/Meta/Frame | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 2 | [ ] | [ ] | Story/Meta/Frame | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 3 | [ ] | [ ] | Story/Meta/Frame | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

### End Brick Check

| Element | Present | Quality (1-5) | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Transition from final point | [ ] | | |
| New problem poked | [ ] | | |
| Stakes established | [ ] | | |
| Specific next video | [ ] | | |
| No summary | [ ] | | |
| No "that's it" language | [ ] | | |

**Output:** Structure audit complete.

## Step 3: Tension-Release Pattern Check

Map all setups and payoffs:

| # | Setup | Location | Payoff | Location | Status |
|---|-------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | | | | | ✓ / ✗ / Too Early |
| 2 | | | | | ✓ / ✗ / Too Early |
| 3 | | | | | ✓ / ✗ / Too Early |
| 4 | | | | | ✓ / ✗ / Too Early |
| 5 | | | | | ✓ / ✗ / Too Early |

**Tension Graph Visualization:**
Describe the curiosity pattern:
- Does it dip at payoffs?
- Does it shoot back up with new setups?
- Are there flat sections (boring)?
- Are there cliff drops (trust broken)?

**Output:** Tension-release map complete.

---

## Step 4: Example Brick Analysis

For each Example Brick:

### Brick #[X]

**Tool Used:** [ ] Story  [ ] Metaphor  [ ] Framework

**If Story:**
- [ ] Real person with specific details
- [ ] Three-part structure (Beginning/Middle/End)
- [ ] Comes BEFORE the explanation (not after)
- [ ] Story type: Personal(10/10) / Client(10/10) / Third-Party(8/10) / Fictional(7/10)

**If Metaphor:**
- [ ] Makes abstract concrete
- [ ] Uses familiar concept
- [ ] Has clear transitions in/out
- [ ] Physical prop opportunity?

**If Framework:**
- [ ] Organizes complex info clearly
- [ ] Easy to remember
- [ ] Type: Acronym / Conceptual / Process

**Show Don't Tell Check:**
- [ ] Demonstrates rather than explains
- [ ] Visual elements where possible
- [ ] Makes viewer feel confident

**Output:** Example bricks analyzed.

---

## Step 5: Application Brick Analysis

For each Application Brick:

### Brick #[X]

**BES Check:**

| Step | Big? | Easy? | Specific? |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 2 | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 3 | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

**Other Checks:**
- [ ] Steps are broken down small enough
- [ ] Matched to audience level
- [ ] Show Don't Tell continues
- [ ] Not vague ("just learn Python")
- [ ] Not overly complex

**Output:** Application bricks analyzed.

---

## Step 6: Common Mistakes Scan

Check against references/common-mistakes.md:

**Tension-Release Mistakes:**
- [ ] No early payoffs
- [ ] No unfulfilled setups

**Introduction Mistakes:**
- [ ] Hook exists and creates curiosity
- [ ] Under 15 seconds
- [ ] Uses "let me show you"

**Content Mistakes:**
- [ ] Advice not too vague
- [ ] Advice not too complex
- [ ] Stories come before explanations
- [ ] No dragging stories out

**Example Brick Mistakes:**
- [ ] Right tool for the job
- [ ] No overused examples
- [ ] Fictional stories executed well (if used)

**Application Brick Mistakes:**
- [ ] Passes BES test
- [ ] Audience level matched
- [ ] Show Don't Tell continues

**End Brick Mistakes:**
- [ ] No summary
- [ ] No rushing off
- [ ] Specific video, not generic

**Output:** Mistakes identified.

---

## Step 7: Audience Fit Validation

Use `audience-avatar` skill to check:
- [ ] Topic resonates with target
- [ ] Language matches how they speak
- [ ] Examples relatable to their situation
- [ ] Steps achievable at their level

**Output:** Audience fit verified.

---

## Step 8: Voice Consistency Check

Use `brand-voice` skill to verify:
- [ ] Consistent voice throughout
- [ ] Matches brand standards
- [ ] No jarring tone shifts

**Output:** Voice verified.

---

## Step 9: Generate Audit Report

**Summary:**
- Overall Score: [X/10]
- Strongest Sections: [List]
- Weakest Sections: [List]
- Priority Fixes: [Numbered list]

**Detailed Findings:**
[Section-by-section breakdown]

**Recommendations:**
[Specific actions to take]

**Output:** Complete audit report.
