## Step 1: Get Context

Ask the user:
1. What is the video topic?
2. What's the thumbnail/title concept?
3. Is this a new intro or improving an existing one?

If improving: Get the current intro script.

**Output:** Context established.

## Step 2: Identify Viewer Questions

From the thumbnail and title, what 3 questions will viewers want answered?

**Template questions:**
- What is [the thing]?
- Why should I [do this/care]?
- How will this help me [achieve goal]?

**Your 3 questions:**
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

These guide the entire intro.

**Output:** 3 viewer questions identified.

## Step 3: Choose Hook Type

**Four options:**

| Type | Best When | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Question** | Directly addressing viewer problem | "Have you ever felt like...?" |
| **Fact** | Surprising statistic available | "66% of entrepreneurs will never..." |
| **Statement** | Bold claim you can back up | "I'm a multimillionaire and I don't own my house..." |
| **Credibility** | Strong authority to establish | "I've been in business for 13 years..." |

**Selected type:** [ ] Question  [ ] Fact  [ ] Statement  [ ] Credibility

**Draft hook:**
> [Write hook here]

## Step 4: Choose Transition Approach

| **Combo** | Both problem AND result |

**Selected approach:** [ ] Poke  [ ] Tease  [ ] Combo

**Draft transition:**
> [Write transition here]

**Output:** Transition drafted.

## Step 5: Create Setup

Address the 3 viewer questions in one statement. Max 3 points.

**Template:**
> "In this video, I'm going to show you [answer to Q1], [answer to Q2], and [answer to Q3]."

**Draft setup:**

**Setup checklist:**
- [ ] Gets viewers excited about what's coming

## Step 7: Transition to First Point

**Template:**

**Draft transition:**
> [Write first point transition]

**Critical check:**
- [ ] Uses "let me show you"
- [ ] NOT "let's talk" / "let's dive in" / "let's discuss"

**Output:** First point transition drafted.
