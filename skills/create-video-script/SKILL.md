## The Video Script Philosophy

The foundation of every YouTube script is **Tension and Release**.

**Core Truths:**
- Your job is to keep viewers curious, then satisfied, then curious again
- Setup-Payoff cycles are the secret to retention
- "Show Don't Tell" through Stories, Metaphors, and Frameworks
- Simplification is your superpower - compress complexity into clarity
- Application must be Big, Easy, and Specific (BES)
- Videos never end - they set up the next problem

**The Format:**
- Introduction: Under 15 seconds (Hook → Transition → Setup → Credibility → First Point)
- Middle: Content Bricks (Transition → Example Brick → Application Brick)
- End: Setup new problem → Point to next video

**The Cardinal Sins:**
1. Paying off too early (kills curiosity)
2. Breaking trust with unfulfilled setups (internal clickbait)
3. Making advice vague OR too complex (lose viewers either way)
4. Telling stories AFTER explaining points (ruins the reveal)

**The AIE Formula:**
Every video must be Actionable, Informative, AND Entertaining.

<intake>
What would you like to do?

1. **Create new script** - Build from scratch through all sections
2. **Improve existing script** - Fill gaps, strengthen weak sections
3. **Audit script** - Check against best practices
4. **Work on specific section** - Deep dive into one part

**Wait for response before proceeding.**

| Response | Next Action |
|----------|-------------|
| 1, "create", "new", "build", "start" | → workflows/create-new-script.md |
| 2, "improve", "fill", "complete", "existing" | → workflows/improve-existing-script.md |
| 3, "audit", "check", "review" | → workflows/audit-script.md |
| 4, "section", "intro", "middle", "end", "brick" | Ask which section, then route |

**Section-specific routing:**
- "intro", "introduction", "hook" → workflows/work-on-introduction.md
- "content", "brick", "middle" → workflows/work-on-content-brick.md
- "example", "story", "metaphor", "framework" → workflows/work-on-example-brick.md
- "application", "steps", "BES" → workflows/work-on-application-brick.md
- "end", "ending", "next video" → workflows/work-on-end-brick.md

## When to Use Other Skills

**For all written copy:**
Call the `brand-voice` skill. Ensures voice consistency.

**For validation:**
Call the `audience-avatar` skill. Check: "Does this resonate with our target?"

## Script Structure

| Section | Components | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Introduction** | Hook → Transition → Setup → Credibility → First Point | Capture attention in under 15 sec |
| **Content Brick** | Transition → Example Brick → Application Brick | Deliver value through show-don't-tell |
| **Example Brick** | Story OR Metaphor OR Framework | Make complex simple, build confidence |
| **Application Brick** | BES Steps (Big, Easy, Specific) | Give actionable takeaways |
| **End Brick** | New Problem → Solution in Next Video | Create binge sessions |

<success_criteria>
A complete video script has:
- [ ] Tension-release pattern throughout (setups matched with payoffs)
- [ ] Introduction under 15 seconds
- [ ] Hook that creates immediate curiosity
- [ ] Setup that addresses viewer questions (max 3 points)
- [ ] Credibility naturally integrated
- [ ] Content bricks with Example + Application structure
- [ ] Example bricks use Show Don't Tell (Story/Metaphor/Framework)
- [ ] Application bricks are BES (Big, Easy, Specific)
- [ ] End brick sets up new problem and points to next video
- [ ] No common mistakes (early payoff, vague advice, etc.)
- [ ] Voice consistent with brand
- [ ] Resonates with target audience
</success_criteria>

<continual_learning>
Before starting work, check for accumulated knowledge:
- Read learnings.md for patterns that work
- Read failures.md for approaches to avoid

After completing a script or audit, suggest running /retrospective to capture new insights.
