## Phase 1: Content Understanding

Ask user:
"Tell me about the business/person you want to cover. What makes this story interesting to you?"

Listen for:
- The core appeal (mystery, wild person, injustice)
- Key facts and events
- What drew them to this topic

## Phase 2: Hook Selection

Present the three archetypes with examples:

"Based on your content, which hook feels right?"

**Option 1: Business Mystery**
Best for: "How do they make money?" stories
Example: Arizona Tea staying at 99¢ for 30 years

**Option 2: Character Reveal**
Best for: Person with wild unknown backstory
Example: Colonel Sanders - gunfights, midwife, 65-year-old starting over

**Option 3: Personal Grievance**
Best for: Something frustrating the audience can relate to
Example: Disney deleting a movie you love for tax write-off

Use AskUserQuestion to get their choice.

## Phase 3: Hook Drafting

Based on selection, walk through the formula:

**If Business Mystery:**
1. "What's the impossible fact?" → Draft opening line
2. "What context makes it MORE impossible?" → Add comparison
3. "What's the conspiracy tease?" → Add "they must be up to something"
4. Present draft hook, ask for feedback

**If Character Reveal:**
1. "What's the knowledge gap?" → Draft "X% don't know..."
2. "What's the character thesis?" → "Complete gangster" equivalent
3. "What are 5-7 shocking facts?" → Rapid-fire list
4. Present draft hook, ask for feedback

**If Personal Grievance:**
1. "What simple thing did you/audience want?" → Personal opening
2. "Who/what made it impossible?" → Identify villain
3. "Why is this frustrating?" → Build righteous anger
4. Present draft hook, ask for feedback

Iterate until they're happy with hook.

## Phase 4: Structure Selection

Present the three structures:

"How should we organize the story?"

**Option A: Chronological Business Journey**
Best for: Company origin/success stories
Flow: Beginning → Insight → Challenge → Gangster Move → Conclusion

**Option B: Biography Timeline**
Best for: Founder/figure profiles
Flow: Early life → Career phases → "Karma kicks in" → Legacy

**Option C: Thematic Investigation**
Best for: Corporate/systemic issues
Flow: Problem → History → Human Story → System → Verdict

Use AskUserQuestion to get their choice.

## Phase 5: Segment Planning

Based on structure, plan segments together:

"Let's map out the segments. For each one, what's the key beat?"

Go through each segment slot:
1. What happens here?
2. What's the humor opportunity?
3. What humanizes the subject?
4. How do we transition to next?

Create outline together.

## Phase 6: Segment-by-Segment Writing

For each segment:
1. Write draft
2. Present to user
3. Get feedback
4. Iterate or move on

Include in each:
- Opening transition
- Core content
- At least one humor beat
- Character moment
- Closing transition

## Phase 7: Conclusion Crafting

"How should we land the moral?"

Present three methods:
1. **Direct extraction** - State it clearly
2. **Question reframing** - Return to opening with new answer
3. **Character verdict** - Let their actions speak

Draft conclusion, get feedback, iterate.

## Phase 8: Full Assembly

Combine all segments into complete script.
Read through for flow.
Present final draft with notes on areas they'll want to personalize.
