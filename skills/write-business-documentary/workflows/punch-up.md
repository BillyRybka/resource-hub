## Step 1: Receive Script

Ask user to paste their existing script or point to the file.

## Step 2: Diagnostic Read

Read through and diagnose:

**Hook Check:**
- Does it create investment? Or just state the topic?
- Which archetype is it closest to?
- Is it following the formula or generic?

**Voice Check:**
- Count humor moments (should be 5+ distributed)
- Is it conversational or stiff?
- Are there signature phrases?

**Character Check:**
- Is the subject humanized?
- Are there "Complete Gangster" moments?
- Do we see flaws AND admirable traits?

**Structure Check:**
- Are transitions smooth?
- Is pacing varied?
- Does moral emerge naturally?

## Step 3: Present Diagnosis

Share findings:
```
## Punch-Up Diagnosis

**Hook**: [Strong/Needs work] - [specific note]
**Humor density**: [X moments] - [needs more in Y section]
**Voice**: [Conversational/Stiff] - [specific examples]
**Character depth**: [Good/Thin] - [what's missing]
**Transitions**: [Smooth/Abrupt] - [problem spots]
**Moral**: [Earned/Tacked on] - [how to fix]

Priority fixes:
1. [Most impactful]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
```

## Step 4: Fix Priority Items

For each priority, apply specific techniques:

**If Hook Needs Work:**
- Identify which archetype fits
- Rewrite following formula
- Add specific numbers/comparisons

**If Humor Lacking:**
Add from the 7 types:
- Absurd comparison: "[Thing] is basically [absurd equivalent]"
- Self-aware tangent: "I'm getting sidetracked here"
- Specificity humor: Weirdly specific details
- Understated delivery: Casual tone for shocking content
- Running gag: Find something to callback
- Fake-out: "And then he became a vampire hunter. No, I'm kidding."
- Escalating absurdity: Stack facts that get wilder

**If Voice Stiff:**
- Replace passive with active voice
- Add signature phrases
- Cut academic language
- Make it speakable (read aloud test)

**If Character Thin:**
- Find a "Complete Gangster" moment
- Add a humanizing flaw
- Show a decision that defines them
- Include a direct quote if available

**If Transitions Abrupt:**
- Add teaser phrases: "But here's where it gets interesting"
- Connect segments thematically
- Use time markers naturally

**If Moral Tacked On:**
- Find where lesson naturally emerges from story
- Remove preaching
- Let character actions demonstrate the point
