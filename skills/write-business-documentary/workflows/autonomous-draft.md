</required_reading>

<process>
## Step 1: Receive Research

Ask the user to provide their research notes, or confirm you have access to them.

Expected input:
- Facts about the business/person
- Key events and decisions
- Interesting details and anecdotes
- Any known controversies or myths
- What makes this story compelling

## Step 2: Analyze Content Type

Based on the research, determine:

**What's the core appeal?**
- Impossible economics → Business Mystery hook
- Wild person → Character Reveal hook
- Injustice/frustration → Personal Grievance hook

**What's the story structure?**
- Company journey → Chronological Business
- Person's life → Biography Timeline
- Systemic issue → Thematic Investigation

State your selections:
```
Hook archetype: [selection] because [reason]
Structure pattern: [selection] because [reason]
```

## Step 3: Identify Key Beats

Extract from research:
1. **Hook material** - The impossible/shocking/frustrating element
2. **Character moments** - Decisions that reveal who they are
3. **Humor opportunities** - Absurd details, comparisons, tangent potential
4. **The moral** - What lesson emerges naturally?
5. **Serious moments** (if any) - Myths to bust, sensitive topics

## Step 4: Write the Hook

Using the selected archetype formula from the guide:

**Business Mystery:**
1. Present the impossible fact
2. Add context that makes it MORE impossible
3. Tease "they must be up to something"
4. Promise investigation

**Character Reveal:**
1. Knowledge check ("X% don't know...")
2. Character thesis ("complete gangster")
3. Rapid-fire shocking facts (5-7)
4. Promise the full story

**Personal Grievance:**
1. Personal vulnerability ("I just wanted...")
2. Simple relatable want
3. Entity that made it impossible
4. Righteous frustration

## Step 5: Outline Segments

Create segment outline based on structure:

**Chronological Business:**
- The Beginning (origin)
- The Insight (key decision)
- The Challenge (conflict)
- The Gangster Move (defining moment)
- The Conclusion (moral)

**Biography Timeline:**
- Early Life (setup)
- First Career Phase
- "And then Karma kicks in" moments
- The Turn (what they're known for)
- Later Life / Legacy
- The Moral

**Thematic Investigation:**
- The Problem (what's wrong)
- The History (how we got here)
- The Human Story (who's affected)
- The System (why it works this way)
- The Verdict (what it means)

## Step 5.5: Voice Calibration (CRITICAL)

<required_reading>
**Read 50 lines from an actual example script NOW:**
@faceless/example2.md (lines 1-50)

**Also read:** references/voice-examples.md
</required_reading>

**Absorb the voice before writing.** Notice:
- Sentences starting with "okay so" and "alright"
- "I mean" and "like" everywhere
- Self-interruptions and asides
- Genuine personal reactions

**If your draft sounds like a documentary narrator, you're doing it wrong.**
**It should sound like you're ranting to a friend about something insane you discovered.**

## Step 6: Write Full Draft

Write each segment with:
- **Transition in** - Connect to previous segment
- **Core content** - Facts presented as story
- **Humor beat** - At least one per segment
- **Character moment** - Humanize the subject
- **Transition out** - Tease what's next

Apply humor types throughout:
- Absurd comparisons
- Self-aware tangents
- Specificity humor
- Understated delivery
- Running gags (if appropriate)

## Step 7: Write the Conclusion

Use one of the three methods:
1. **Direct extraction** - State the lesson explicitly
2. **Question reframing** - Return to opening question with new perspective
3. **Character verdict** - Let subject's actions speak

Avoid:
- Preaching
- Adding new information
- Excessive summary

## Step 8: Read Aloud Pass

Read the script out loud (or simulate). Check:
- Does it flow conversationally?
- Are there tongue-twisters?
- Do transitions feel natural?
- Is humor landing or forced?

Make adjustments.

## Step 9: Deliver Draft

Present the complete script with:
- Clear segment breaks
- [NOTES] for any areas needing user input
- Suggestion for where sponsor read would go
