</required_reading>

<process>
## Step 1: Understand the Content

Ask: "What's the topic and what makes it interesting?"

Listen for signals:
- "Doesn't make sense" / "impossible" → Business Mystery
- "This person was crazy" / "you won't believe" → Character Reveal
- "They screwed over" / "it's unfair" → Personal Grievance

## Step 2: Recommend Archetype

Based on signals, recommend an archetype:

"This sounds like a [archetype] hook because [reason]. Want to go with that, or try a different angle?"

## Step 3: Execute Formula

**Business Mystery Formula:**
```
1. IMPOSSIBLE FACT: "[Specific number/fact] that shouldn't be possible"
   - Use exact numbers
   - Make it concrete

2. CONTEXT THAT AMPLIFIES: "Which is insane because [comparison]"
   - Compare to something audience knows
   - Show why this defies expectations

3. CONSPIRACY TEASE: "They're clearly up to something"
   - Create curiosity about HOW
   - Promise investigation

4. INVESTIGATION PROMISE: "And we're going to get into it"
```

**Character Reveal Formula:**
```
1. KNOWLEDGE CHECK: "Only X% of people know [subject] was real/did Y"
   - Establish gap between perception and reality

2. CHARACTER THESIS: "[Subject] was a complete [characterization]"
   - "Complete gangster"
   - "Absolute madman"
   - Set up the contradiction

3. SHOCKING FACT BARRAGE: 5-7 rapid-fire facts
   - Each one more surprising
   - Mix serious and absurd
   - Build to wildest one

4. STORY PROMISE: "And I could keep going, but we're going to cover all of it"
```

**Personal Grievance Formula:**
```
1. VULNERABILITY: "I just wanted to [simple thing]"
   - Personal and relatable
   - Something audience might also want

2. ENTITY BLOCKING: "But [entity] made it [impossible/illegal]"
   - Clear villain
   - Absurd overreach

3. RIGHTEOUS FRUSTRATION: "[Emotional reaction]"
   - Match audience feeling
   - Not whiny, indignant

4. INVESTIGATION PROMISE: "We're going to get into all of it"
```

## Step 4: Draft Hook

Write complete hook following formula.

Include:
- Specific numbers/facts
- At least one absurd comparison
- The investigation promise
- Conversational voice

## Step 5: Present and Iterate

Show draft hook.
Ask: "How does this feel? What would you change?"
Iterate based on feedback.

## Step 6: Deliver Final Hook

Present polished hook with:
- The hook text
- Note on where sponsor placement would go (after hook)
- Suggestion for first segment transition
