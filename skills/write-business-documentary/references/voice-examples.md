## Documentary Narrator (DON'T DO THIS)

This is what happens when you write "clean" and "professional":

> Red Bull was founded in 1984 through a partnership between Chaleo Yoovidhya and Dietrich Mateschitz. The ownership structure was elegant: 49% to each founder, with 2% to Chaleo's son. This arrangement gave the Thai family majority control while granting Mateschitz operational authority.

**Problems:**
- No "okay" or "I mean" or "like"
- No self-interruptions
- No genuine reactions
- Reads like a Wikipedia article
- Zero personality

## Personal Rant (DO THIS)

This is what the actual scripts sound like:

> Okay so I need somebody to explain to me how any of this makes sense. Red Bull—the energy drink company that's literally everywhere, owns like half of Formula 1, pays people to jump out of space—Red Bull was invented by a Thai guy whose dad raised ducks. Like, actual ducks. On a farm. In rural Thailand.
>
> And then some Austrian dude who spent his entire career selling toothpaste tried it on a business trip, and the two of them just... shook hands, split the company basically 50/50, and then apparently decided to never really talk to each other for the next forty years.
>
> And it worked.
>
> Okay I need you to understand how insane that is.

**What makes this work:**
- Starts with "Okay so"
- Uses "like" naturally mid-sentence
- Self-interrupts with parenthetical asides
- Genuine incredulity ("I need you to understand")
- Sounds like talking to a friend

## Specific Patterns to Use

**Sentence starters:**
- "Okay so..."
- "Alright so..."
- "Now here's the thing..."
- "And here's where it gets crazy..."

**Mid-sentence markers:**
- "—I need you to really hear this—"
- "like, actual [X]"
- "I mean"
- "which is insane because"

**Reactions:**
- "I don't know what to tell you. That's just what happened."
- "Do you understand how crazy that is?"
- "I'm going to say that again because I don't think you heard me."
- "Complete gangster."

**Self-awareness:**
- "I'm going to butcher this pronunciation"
- "This started as a [X] video. It just turned into a [Y] video."
