description: Write business documentary scripts in the investigative, witty style. Use when you have research notes on a business/founder and want to produce a compelling script with hooks, humor, and moral conclusions.

<essential_principles>
## Source of Truth

All writing follows the patterns in: @faceless/business-documentary-guide.md

Read that guide before writing. It contains:
- 3 hook archetypes (Personal Grievance, Business Mystery, Character Reveal)
- 3 structure patterns (Thematic Investigation, Chronological Business, Biography Timeline)
- 7 humor types with examples
- Character building techniques ("Complete Gangster" framework)
- Conclusion/moral extraction methods
- Transition and pacing guidelines

## Core DNA (Non-Negotiable)

Every script MUST have:
1. **Hook that creates investment** - Not just "today we're talking about X"
2. **Humanized subject** - Business people as characters with flaws and motivations
3. **Witty voice throughout** - Absurd comparisons, tangents, self-aware humor
4. **Natural moral extraction** - Lesson emerges from story, not tacked on
5. **Conversational flow** - Written for speaking, not reading

## Voice Signature

Use phrases like:
- "Do you understand how crazy this is?"
- "Just so we're on the same page..."
- "Complete gangster" / "absolute badass"
- "And that's when things get interesting"
- "But here's where it gets insane"

**For concrete before/after examples, see:** references/voice-examples.md

Avoid:
- Academic language
- Passive voice
- Generic YouTube opener ("Hey guys, today we're...")
- Explaining jokes

What would you like to do?

1. **Write script (autonomous)** - I have research, produce a complete draft
2. **Write script (guided)** - Walk me through hook → structure → segments
3. **Just the hook** - Help me nail the opening
4. **Punch up existing script** - Add wit and improve flow

**Wait for response before proceeding.**

<hook_archetype_selector>
## Quick Hook Selection

Ask yourself about the content:

**Is there a clear "this doesn't make sense" business angle?**
→ Business Mystery archetype
- "How does X stay at $Y price?"
- "They're clearly up to something"

**Is there a person with a wild unknown backstory?**
→ Character Reveal archetype
- "You're not prepared for how crazy this is"
- Rapid-fire shocking facts

**Is there injustice/frustration the audience can relate to?**
→ Personal Grievance archetype
- "I just wanted to X, but [entity] made it impossible"
- Vulnerability + corporate villain
</hook_archetype_selector>

<structure_selector>
## Quick Structure Selection

**Corporate/systemic story (Disney, tax loopholes, industry practices)**
→ Thematic Investigation
- Jump between timelines
- Narrator as advocate
- Build to systemic critique

**Company origin/success story (Arizona Tea, startup journeys)**
→ Chronological Business Journey
- Follow the business timeline
- Segment labels (The Beginning, The Value Proposition)
- Decision points as character moments

**Founder/figure profile (Colonel Sanders, eccentric CEO)**
→ Biography Timeline
- Follow the person's life
- "Karma vs protagonist" framing
- Running gags throughout
