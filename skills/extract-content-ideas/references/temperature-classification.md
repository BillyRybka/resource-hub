# Temperature Classification

How to categorize content by its role in the audience journey.

## The Temperature Model

Content "temperature" describes where content fits in the customer journey:

```
COLD ────────────────> WARM ────────────────> HOT
Discovery              Trust-Building          Conversion
New Audience           Existing Audience       Ready-to-Buy
```

## Cold Content (Discovery)

**Purpose**: Attract new people who don't know you yet.

**Characteristics**:
- Broad appeal (relevant to many people)
- Highly shareable
- Curiosity-driven
- Low commitment to consume
- No assumed knowledge of you/your work

**Who Finds It**: New people through search, shares, recommendations, algorithms

**Action After Consuming**: Share, follow, subscribe, watch another video

**Examples**:
- "The #1 mistake most YouTubers make"
- "What [famous person] gets wrong about [topic]"
- "A simple trick I learned from [unexpected source]"

**Best Formats**:
- YouTube Shorts / TikTok / Reels
- Twitter/X posts and threads
- LinkedIn posts
- Carousel graphics
- Podcast clips

**Value Unit Types That Work**:
- Quick tactic/tip
- Contrarian take
- Mistake/warning
- Framework teaser (intro only)

## Warm Content (Trust-Building)

**Purpose**: Deepen relationship with people who already know you.

**Characteristics**:
- More depth and nuance
- Builds credibility and authority
- Shows expertise clearly
- Medium commitment to consume
- Some assumed familiarity with your perspective

**Who Finds It**: Existing subscribers, followers, email list members

**Action After Consuming**: Trust you more, see you as authority, engage deeper, consider offers

**Examples**:
- "My complete framework for [topic]"
- "How I helped [client] achieve [result]"
- "The full process I use for [outcome]"

**Best Formats**:
- Long-form YouTube videos (10-20 min)
- Email sequences
- Blog posts
- Podcast episodes
- LinkedIn articles
- Detailed carousels

**Value Unit Types That Work**:
- Framework/mental model (full)
- Story/case study
- Step-by-step process
- Behind-the-scenes

## Hot Content (Conversion)

**Purpose**: Move engaged audience toward taking action (usually buying).

**Characteristics**:
- Very specific and actionable
- Tied directly to your offer
- Shows transformation proof
- Addresses objections
- High commitment (only engaged people consume)
- Assumes relationship exists

**Who Finds It**: Engaged leads, warm list, people considering purchase

**Action After Consuming**: Buy, book call, join program, take offer

**Examples**:
- "Exactly how [client] went from [A] to [B] using [your method]"
- "The 3 things you need before [transformation] is possible"
- "Why [common approach] keeps failing and what to do instead"

**Best Formats**:
- Webinars
- Deep-dive case study videos
- Sales emails
- Demo videos
- Comparison content
- Objection-handling content

**Value Unit Types That Work**:
- Transformation proof
- Detailed case study
- Method walkthrough
- Direct how-to for specific outcome

## Temperature Transitions

Content types can shift temperature based on execution:

| Base Type | Cold Version | Warm Version | Hot Version |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Framework | "Here's a mental model" (teaser) | "The complete framework" | "How to apply [framework] to get [specific result]" |
| Story | "One lesson from a client" | "Full client transformation" | "How [client] used [your offer] to get [result]" |
| Process | "One step that changes everything" | "The full 5-step process" | "Step-by-step: How to [outcome] using [product]" |

## Classification Questions

When classifying a value unit's temperature:

1. **Who would find this?**
   - New people through discovery = Cold
   - Existing audience seeking depth = Warm
   - People ready to buy = Hot

2. **What action follows?**
   - Share/follow = Cold
   - Engage deeper/trust more = Warm
   - Buy/book = Hot

3. **How specific is it?**
   - Broad principles = Cold
   - Detailed frameworks = Warm
   - Specific implementation with your method = Hot

4. **How much assumed context?**
   - None (standalone) = Cold
   - Some familiarity with your work = Warm
   - Relationship and interest in offer = Hot

## Content Mix Guidelines

A healthy content portfolio has all three temperatures:

**Recommended Mix**:
- Cold: 40-50% (constant new audience acquisition)
- Warm: 30-40% (building trust with existing audience)
- Hot: 10-20% (conversion for ready buyers)

**Warning Signs**:
- All Cold: Building audience but no trust/conversion
- All Warm: Preaching to choir, no new audience
- All Hot: Burning out list, no new people coming in
- No Hot: Not monetizing the audience you built

## Integration with Extraction

When extracting value units from source content:

1. **Identify natural temperature**: What temperature is this unit inherently?
2. **Consider modifications**: Could this be adapted to different temperature?
3. **Check balance**: Does extraction provide mix of temperatures?
4. **Prioritize gaps**: If portfolio lacks cold content, prioritize cold units.
