# Content Extraction Framework

The mental model for mining existing content for standalone value units.

## Core Concept

Content is not monolithic. A 30-minute video isn't one piece of content - it's 5-15 problem-solution units stacked together.

**The Insight**: Each unit solves ONE specific problem and can potentially stand alone. Some individual units are more valuable than the whole.

## What is a Value Unit?

A value unit is a segment of content that:
- Solves ONE specific problem
- Can stand alone without surrounding context
- Has clear transformation (viewer's before → after)
- Enables immediate action

**Examples:**
- A 3-minute story about a client transformation (from a 45-min podcast)
- A framework explanation (from a 20-min video)
- A contrarian take on industry wisdom (from a blog post)
- A step-by-step tactic (from a course module)

## The 4-Filter Process

Every potential value unit must pass through 4 sequential filters. Fail one = doesn't become content (or needs modification).

### Filter 1: Problem Identification

**Question**: "What SPECIFIC problem does this segment solve?"

**Pass Criteria**:
- Real problem people actually have (not theoretical)
- Specific enough to be solvable (not vague like "be better")
- Completable - viewer knows when problem is solved

**Examples**:
- PASS: "I don't know what to say in the first 15 seconds of my video"
- FAIL: "I want to be a better content creator" (too vague)
- FAIL: "Understanding human psychology" (not a problem, just a topic)

### Filter 2: Standalone Test

**Question**: "Can this make sense WITHOUT the surrounding content?"

**Pass Criteria**:
- No required context from earlier in the source
- Doesn't reference unexplained concepts
- New viewer understands value immediately

**Examples**:
- PASS: Story has its own beginning, middle, end
- FAIL: "As I mentioned earlier..." with no explanation
- FAIL: References "the framework from step 2" without restating it

**Note**: Some fails can be rescued by adding brief context at the start.

### Filter 3: Iceberg Alignment

**Question**: "Does this fit our positioning?"

The iceberg concept: Your content shows the tip (specific tactical advice) that implies a much larger body of expertise underwater.

**Pass Criteria**:
- Demonstrates expertise in your core domain
- Attracts the right audience (people who could become customers)
- Connects logically to what you sell/offer

**Examples**:
- PASS: YouTube strategy tip (if you sell YouTube services)
- FAIL: Random life advice (if you sell YouTube services)
- FAIL: Content that attracts wrong audience (hobbyists when you serve businesses)

### Filter 4: Demand Signal

**Question**: "Is there evidence people WANT this solved?"

**Pass Criteria** (any of these):
- Comments asking about this topic
- Search volume for related queries
- Questions in communities/forums
- Competitor content performing well on topic
- DMs/emails asking about this
- Personal experience of demand

**Results**:
- PASS: Clear evidence of demand
- FAIL: Evidence people don't care
- UNKNOWN: No evidence either way (still viable, lower priority)

## The Extraction Mindset

### Before Extraction (Wrong)
- "This video is about X"
- "I need to repurpose my video"
- "What clips can I cut from this?"

### After Extraction (Right)
- "This video contains 8 problem-solution units"
- "3 of these can stand alone as separate content"
- "Each unit attracts different people at different stages"

## Practical Application

When analyzing source content:

1. **Initial Pass**: Read/watch looking for topic shifts, problem mentions, solution reveals, story starts
2. **Segment**: Group into candidate value units
3. **Filter**: Run each through the 4 filters sequentially
4. **Document**: Full spec for passing units (problem, solution, type, temperature, formats)
5. **Prioritize**: Based on demand signals and production effort

## Common Mistakes

1. **Treating the whole as the unit**: Trying to "repurpose a video" instead of extracting units
2. **Skipping filters**: Jumping straight to "what can I clip?" without validation
3. **Forcing standalone**: Keeping context-dependent content that doesn't work alone
4. **Ignoring demand**: Creating content from units no one wants solved
5. **Off-iceberg content**: Extracting units that don't align with positioning

## Integration with Content Strategy

Value units feed into the content temperature system:

| Unit Type | Typical Temp | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Quick tactic | Cold | Discovery, new audience |
| Framework | Cold → Warm | Depth, credibility |
| Story | Warm | Trust-building |
| Step-by-step | Warm → Hot | Authority, pre-conversion |
| Case study | Hot | Proof, conversion |

Extraction should yield a mix of temperatures to serve the full funnel.
