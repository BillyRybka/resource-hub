# Value Unit Criteria

What makes a valid, high-quality value unit.

## Core Definition

A value unit is a segment of content that solves ONE specific problem and can stand alone.

## Required Criteria (Must Have All)

### 1. Specific Problem

The unit must address a clear, specific problem.

**Good Problems**:
- "I don't know how to start my YouTube videos"
- "My thumbnails get low click-through rates"
- "I can't figure out why my content isn't converting"

**Bad Problems**:
- "Content creation" (topic, not problem)
- "Be a better creator" (too vague)
- "Understand marketing" (not actionable)

**Test**: Can you complete the sentence "After consuming this, the viewer will know how to ___"?

### 2. Clear Transformation

Before and after states must be obvious.

**Format**: Viewer goes from [confused/stuck/struggling with X] to [clear/unstuck/capable of X]

**Examples**:
- Before: Doesn't know what makes a good hook → After: Can identify and write 4 types of hooks
- Before: Overwhelmed by content ideas → After: Has framework for extracting ideas from existing content

### 3. Standalone Capability

Must make sense without external context.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] No "as I mentioned earlier" that requires prior content
- [ ] No undefined terms or unexplained references
- [ ] Has own beginning, middle, end
- [ ] New viewer gets full value immediately

### 4. Actionability

Viewer can DO something after consuming.

**Types of Actions**:
- Apply a tactic immediately
- Use a framework for decision-making
- Avoid a specific mistake
- Start a process with clear first step

**Not Actionable**:
- Pure information with no application
- Vague inspiration without specifics
- Theory without practice

## Quality Indicators (Scoring)

### Problem Clarity (1-5)
- 5: Crystal clear, one sentence problem everyone recognizes
- 4: Clear problem, might need slight context
- 3: Identifiable problem, somewhat broad
- 2: Problem exists but vague
- 1: No clear problem addressed

### Standalone Quality (1-5)
- 5: Completely self-contained, zero dependencies
- 4: Nearly standalone, trivial context helps
- 3: Mostly standalone, some assumed knowledge
- 2: Requires moderate external context
- 1: Cannot stand alone at all

### Iceberg Alignment (1-5)
- 5: Perfect fit with core expertise and audience
- 4: Strong alignment, clearly in wheelhouse
- 3: Related to expertise, some connection
- 2: Tangentially related
- 1: Off-topic or attracts wrong audience

### Demand Evidence (1-5)
- 5: Strong multi-source evidence (search, comments, sales)
- 4: Good evidence from multiple signals
- 3: Some evidence, not overwhelming
- 2: Weak signals or single source
- 1: No evidence or negative signals

### Hook Potential (1-5)
- 5: Obvious viral hook, stops the scroll guaranteed
- 4: Strong hook, high attention potential
- 3: Good hook, solid but not exceptional
- 2: Weak hook, needs work
- 1: No clear hook possibility

**Quality Threshold**: Units scoring below 15/25 total need improvement or should be discarded.

## Value Unit Types

| Type | Description | Typical Length | Best Temp |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Quick tactic/tip | Single actionable thing | 1-3 min | Cold |
| Framework/mental model | System for thinking | 5-10 min | Cold-Warm |
| Story/case study | Narrative with lesson | 3-7 min | Warm |
| Contrarian take | Against common belief | 1-3 min | Cold |
| Step-by-step process | Sequential how-to | 5-15 min | Warm-Hot |
| Mistake/warning | What NOT to do | 1-3 min | Cold |
| Transformation proof | Evidence of results | 3-7 min | Hot |

## Red Flags (Automatic Disqualification)

- **No Problem**: Just information without solving anything
- **Multiple Problems**: Tries to solve too many things (split it)
- **Context Dependent**: Cannot be understood alone
- **Off-Brand**: Doesn't align with expertise or attracts wrong audience
- **Zero Demand**: Evidence suggests no one cares
- **No Transformation**: Viewer unchanged after consuming

## Rescue Patterns

Some failed units can be saved:

| Issue | Rescue |
|-------|--------|
| Too context-dependent | Add 30-second setup at start |
| Multiple problems | Split into separate units |
| Weak problem | Reframe around clearer problem |
| No hook | Find the surprising/contrarian angle |
| Vague transformation | Make the before/after more specific |
