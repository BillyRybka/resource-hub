# Business Documentary Script-Writing Guide - Creation Summary

**One-liner**: Created the definitive 800+ line guide for writing investigative, witty business documentary scripts with three distinct hook archetypes and comprehensive pattern libraries.

---

## Key Patterns Extracted

### 1. Hook Archetypes Are Content-Dependent
The three scripts use fundamentally different opening strategies based on content type:
- **Personal Grievance** (Togo): Vulnerability + simple want + corporate interference - best for injustice stories
- **Business Mystery** (Arizona): Impossible economics + comparison anchors + conspiracy tease - best for "how do they make money?" stories
- **Character Reveal** (Sanders): Knowledge check + character thesis + shocking fact barrage - best for biography/founder stories

### 2. The "Complete Gangster" Framework
All three scripts share a technique of reframing business decisions as badass character moments. Pattern: Show the easy path → Show what they actually chose → Deliver the "gangster verdict." This transforms dry business facts into character revelations.

### 3. Humor Types Are Systematic
Identified 7 distinct humor patterns used across all scripts:
- Absurd comparisons ("like if Costco only sold hot dogs")
- Running gags (medulla oblongata, big cans)
- Self-aware tangents (acknowledging when going off-topic)
- Specificity humor (30+ "greats" in a row)
- Fake-out tangents (vampire hunter setup)
- Escalating absurdity (fact barrages)
- Understated delivery (shocking content, casual tone)

### 4. Karma as Narrative Device
Colonel Sanders script personifies "Karma" as an antagonist throughout the biography, creating narrative tension in what could be dry chronology. Pattern: "Karma kicks in → [setback] → [subject] is not taking no for an answer → [overcomes]"

### 5. Serious Moments Are Surgical
When scripts get serious (myth-busting, emotional quotes, values statements), they share characteristics:
- SHORT duration
- FACTUAL tone (no jokes)
- Immediate transition back to normal voice
- Often using direct quotes to let subject speak
