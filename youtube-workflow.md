## Stage 1: Research (Pattern Bank)

**Goal:** Build and maintain a library of proven patterns from successful videos.

### Building Your Pattern Bank

#### Step 1: Find Channels to Analyze

Find 5+ channels in your niche:
- Check YouTube Studio → Audience → "Audience also watches"
- Search for problems your viewers care about
- **Best method:** Create a "dummy account"
  - New YouTube account (don't upload)
  - Watch videos your ideal viewer would watch
  - Like and subscribe to relevant channels
  - Check homepage daily to discover new content

#### Step 2: Identify Outliers

Outliers = videos that performed way better than a channel's average.

For each channel, analyze:
- **Last 12 months:** Look for videos 2X+ average views (large channels) or 5X+ (smaller channels)
- **Most Popular tab:** Analyze videos from last 2 years

Use the "One or Ten" Chrome extension to see outlier multiples.

#### Step 3: Log the Data

For each outlier, record:

| Field | What to Capture |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Title** | Full title (copy video link) |
| **Thumbnail** | Screenshot for vision board |
| **Topic** | General idea of the video |
| **Power Words** | Words that make big claims, suggest easy results, feel safe, or promise new info |
| **Thumbnail Elements** | Celebrities, text overlays, graphs, dollar signs, etc. |

#### Step 4: Spot Patterns

After analyzing several outliers:
- Sort spreadsheet columns alphabetically
- Highlight repeating elements
- Use AI to help identify patterns (upload as CSV)

### If Your Niche Lacks Patterns

Go to adjacent niches:
1. Start with direct niche (e.g., yoga lessons)
2. Go wider (e.g., mobility and movement)
3. Go even wider (e.g., general fitness)

Borrow title structures, thumbnail designs, power words—not topics.

**This is not one-and-done.** Update regularly. The more time researching, the better your results.

---

## Stage 2: Ideation

**Goal:** Generate video ideas validated by outlier data.

### Connect Outliers to Your Positioning

Review your outlier video ideas. Ask:
- Which relate directly to my Iceberg Top?
- Which address my avatar's fears, goals, and problems?

Not all outliers fit. If an outlier doesn't match your positioning, skip it (even if it got lots of views).

### Ideation Methods

1. **Direct adaptation:** Take an outlier topic, apply to your positioning
2. **Combine outliers:** Merge elements from two successful videos
3. **Adjacent application:** Apply patterns from adjacent niches to your topic

### Maintain Idea Pipeline

Keep a running list of 10-20 validated video ideas. Replenish as you publish.

## Stage 3: Packaging (Title + Thumbnail)

**CRITICAL: Create thumbnail and title FIRST, before scripting.**

Why:
- Forces you to think about competition
- Ensures content aligns with promise
- Prevents misleading packaging
- Provides clear creative direction

### The BENS Copywriting System

Every title/thumbnail should include at least one:

| Element | What It Does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **B**ig | Promises significant impact | "The Trick That Changed My Life" |
| **E**asy | Makes solution seem accessible | "5 Simple Steps to..." |
| **N**ew | Presents info as fresh/undiscovered | "You've Never Seen This Before" |
| **S**afe | Builds trust/credibility | "Proven Method to Stop X" |

**Additional techniques:**
- **Specificity:** Use exact numbers ("$14,322" not "lots of money")
- **Urgency:** Create stakes ("Do this before Instagram changes...")

### Title Creation Process

**Options:**
1. Copy exact outlier title structure
2. Combine two outlier titles
3. Use outlier with power word twist
4. Pull repeating power words into something new

**Title Checklist:**
- [ ] Under 50 characters?
- [ ] Includes BENS element?
- [ ] Aligns with channel positioning?
- [ ] No jargon or confusing words?
- [ ] Built using outlier patterns?
- [ ] NO COLONS (":") — they wreck flow

### Thumbnail Creation Process

#### Step 1: Create 3 Strategy Doodles

Pick from these proven styles:

| Style | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| **Cognitive Dissonance** | Challenge commonly held belief |
| **Before/After** | Show clear transformation |
| **Results-Oriented** | Display the desirable outcome |
| **Social Hacking** | Feature recognizable people/brands |
| **Curiosity-Driven** | Provoke "What? How? Why?" |
| **Cinematic/Minimal** | High-quality photography, minimal text |

#### Step 2: Create Variations

For each of the 3 strategies, create 2 variations (change text, objects, etc.).

**You now have 9 thumbnail drafts.**

#### Step 3: Initial Feedback

1. Upload thumbnails to thumbsup.tv with title
2. Screenshot each
3. Create vision board with outliers you based them on
4. Get feedback on:
   - Does image create intrigue?
   - Works with title?
   - Concept clear?
   - Competitive against outliers?

#### Step 4: Produce Final Versions

Refine based on feedback. Create polished versions of top 3.

### Thumbnail Design Principles

**Four Elements That Get Clicks:**
1. **Curiosity** - Make viewers think "What? How? Why?"
2. **Clear Hero** - One element that stands out immediately
3. **Context** - Viewers understand what the topic is
4. **Simplicity** - 2-3 elements maximum

**8 Design Guidelines:**
1. Master space management (breathing room around elements)
2. Use color strategically (3 main colors max, high contrast)
3. Choose legible fonts (sans serif like Helvetica, Montserrat)
4. Optimize text (4 words max, large enough for mobile)
5. Adjust tracking/line spacing
6. Elevate stock images (modify, don't use generic)
7. Perfect positioning (center important elements)
8. Use directional elements (arrows, circles) sparingly

**9 Mistakes to Avoid:**
1. Overcrowding (stick to 2-3 elements)
2. Poor visual hierarchy (one clear hero)
3. Serif fonts (use sans serif)
4. Overusing effects (keep it clean)
5. Dead corners (avoid lower-right, upper-right edges)
6. Overusing strokes/outlines
7. Inside jokes (must make sense to new viewers)
8. Hiding key elements (don't cover the interesting parts)
9. Mismatched expressions (match emotion to content)

#### Step 5: Design Feedback

Get feedback on:
- Color/contrast
- Text readability
- Composition/spacing
- Element sizing

#### Step 6: Ready for Split Test

You'll upload 3 thumbnails to YouTube's split tester at launch.

## Stage 4: Scripting

**Goal:** Write a script that delivers on the thumbnail/title promise.

**Use the `create-video-script` skill** for detailed scripting guidance.

### Core Principles

- **Tension and Release:** Keep viewers curious, then satisfied, then curious again
- **Show Don't Tell:** Use stories, metaphors, and frameworks
- **Introduction under 15 seconds:** Hook → Transition → Setup → Credibility → First Point
- **Application is BES:** Big, Easy, Specific

### Script Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Introduction** | Capture attention, set up the video |
| **Content Bricks** | Deliver value (Example Brick + Application Brick) |
| **End Brick** | Set up new problem, point to next video |

### Cardinal Sins

1. Paying off too early (kills curiosity)
2. Breaking trust with unfulfilled setups
3. Making advice vague OR too complex
4. Telling stories AFTER explaining points

---

## Stage 5: Production

**Goal:** Film and edit the video with appropriate visual storytelling.

### A-Roll vs B-Roll

- **A-Roll:** Primary footage (you speaking to camera)
- **B-Roll:** Supplementary footage that plays while narration continues

### Visual Storytelling Benefits

- Builds trust and perceived value
- Enhances engagement and retention
- Makes content more memorable
- Creates "downhill moments" in the mental marathon

### B-Roll Types

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Illustrative** | Products, processes, examples of concepts |
| **Emotional** | Facial expressions, interactions, mood-setting |
| **Metaphorical** | Visual representations of abstract concepts |

### Implementation Approach

1. **Start simple:** Master fundamentals first (script, presence)
2. **Practice in middle sections:** Add basic B-roll where viewers are forgiving
3. **Front-load quality:** Enhance first 30-60 seconds with best visuals
4. **Expand gradually:** Increase complexity as skills improve

### Production Options

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Film your own** | Authentic, full control | Learning curve, time |
| **Stock footage** | Quick, no skills needed | Less personal, can feel generic |
| **Hire videographer** | Professional quality | Most expensive, requires planning |

### Time-Saving Tips

- Batch shoot B-roll for multiple videos
- Build reusable B-roll library
- Start with simple shots (no complex setups)
- Use AI tools to generate/enhance visuals

---

## Stage 6: Launch

**Goal:** Publish with optimized settings and begin split testing.

### Pre-Launch Checklist

- [ ] Title finalized (under 50 chars, BENS, no colons)
- [ ] 3 thumbnails ready for split test
- [ ] Description written (lead magnet/offer link first)
- [ ] Tags added (if using)
- [ ] End screens configured
- [ ] Cards added at strategic points
- [ ] Publish time: 15 min before peak audience hours

### Split Testing Process

1. Upload all 3 thumbnail strategies to YouTube's split tester
2. Allow sufficient time for data:
   - Small channels: May take several days
   - Established channels: May take a few hours
3. Once clear winner emerges, set as primary
4. If video underperforms, test variations of winning strategy

### First 24 Hours

- Check view count and CTR from subscriber traffic
- Review early comment sentiment
- Verify reaching hot viewers initially

---

## Stage 7: Refinement

**Goal:** Learn from results and improve next video.

### Days 2-7 Check

- Is YouTube testing with warm audiences? (expanded impressions)
- Is returning viewer percentage growing?
- Any unusual traffic source patterns?

### Week 1+ Analysis

- Is video expanding to cold audiences?
- Settling into consistent view pattern?
- Should you adjust thumbnail/title based on data?

### Then Stop Obsessing

Schedule weekly review of overall channel performance. Release your next video.

### What to Learn

For each video, identify:
- Which title/thumbnail patterns worked?
- Where did retention drop?
- What content resonated most (comments)?
- Which traffic sources performed?

### The Sequel Strategy

When a video performs notably better:
1. Create "sequels" with similar format
2. Similar thumbnail design, nearly identical title structure
3. Space them out (don't make 5 similar videos in a row)
4. Try at least 3 versions before abandoning a format

### Continuous Improvement

After every video:
- Update pattern bank with new learnings
- Note what worked in your tracking system
- Identify patterns across multiple videos
- Apply insights to next video's packaging
