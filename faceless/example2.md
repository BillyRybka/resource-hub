all right this is easily the most
requested business for me to look
into today we're talking about Arizona
te and I think the reason so many people
have requested this is fairly obvious
clearly Arizona is up to something
selling these giant cans of tea for 9
which right out of the gate feels weird
but then it gets even weirder when you
realize that they've been selling that
same can of tea for the same exact price
since 1992 okay inflation has gone up
124% since then meaning that if they
just wanted to maintain everything that
can of tea should cost at least
$224 okay bear in mind we live in a
world where as of 2021 the Dollar Tree
is now the do25 tree okay the only other
product that is sacred is the Costco
$150 hot dog and to make that even kind
of feasible Costco had to go out and buy
two hot dog making factories and they
still lose money on it okay the only
reason Costco is staying in business is
because they make so much money on all
the other things they sell they can just
afford to take a loss on the hot dog
which makes the Arizona teac can
absolutely insane because it's the
equivalent of Costco only selling hot
dogs they have to be losing money it
doesn't even seem feasible they're
clearly up to something and we're going
to get into it right after a word from

finances today go check out rocket money
I will have a link in the description
down below let's get back to the
video there's a baby monitor in my
office all right our story begins with
The Beginning
the owner of Arizona te John voltagio in
the 1970s he was a truck driver for an
alcohol distribution service essentially
he was driving a truck around the city
and he would deliver all the alcohol to
convenience stores and gas stations and
he did that for years after doing this
for years him and his cooworker John
falo decided they're going to start
their own distribution service however
as I'm sure you can imagine that's a
very tough business to get into and
initially the only clients that they
could get were all the convenience
stores and gas stations on the sketchy
part of town that nobody else wanted to
deliver to but they did it anyways then
after they had a fairly successful
distribution service they figured hey
we're already carrying all these
different types of beverages to deliver
them to all the convenience stores and
we have those relationships what if we
started our own Brewery and started
making our own alcoholic beverage and
then we could just have one more product
to be able to offer all these clients so
they did and that was fairly successful
also so now that they have their own
alcohol they have to figure out how to
Market it and this is where John
voltagio really figures out how to
Market a product and he looks around at
all the other successful products in the
alcohol Market in the 1980s and just
The 1980s
call a spade a spade here the 1980s is
the Pinnacle of the sleazy advertisement
era okay I mean we've got camels trying
to sell children flavored cigarettes and
we've got every alcohol company on the
planet desperately trying to convince
you that if you drink [ __ ] Bud Light
or Coors Light or whatever a supermodel
is going to be attracted to you and your
beer gut so John voltagio learning how
to Market a product he's like okay step
one make it cool step two have a
supermodel with huge cans promote it
easy they then proceed to name their
beer midnight dragon which is the
coolest [ __ ] name for a beer I've
ever heard and this is in 2024 if you
adjust for inflation it had to have been
way cooler back in the 1980s I mean even
today that's a brilliant name imagine
going over to your buddy's house he
opens up the fridge oh what did you want
to drink we've got Miller Light and
midnight dragon dragon I mean at that
point you could literally be a Miller
like guy and you're still going to try
at least one midnight dragon you have to
so step one make it cool check step two
make it sexy right sex sells I present
to you their first ever advertisement a
beer post of a model in red lingerie
holding a 40 of midnight dragon with a
straw with the caption I could suck on
this all night damn the fact that it's a
40 is just completely outrageous like
the notion that anyone in the history of
mankind has ever been drinking a 40
while simultaneously also concerned
about smearing their lipstick is just
completely unhinged like I need a part
two of this beer advertisement I know
that straw doesn't reach the bottom of
that 40 what happens when the straw
doesn't reach anymore do you just throw
it away and get another 40 or are you
going to be so drunk off the first 20
ounces you're not going to care about
your lipstick anymore I'm sorry I'm
getting sidetracked anyway this goes on
until like 1990 and John voltagio while
he's delivering beer one day there's
another distributor there and he's
actually dropping off a bunch of Snapple
and John voltagio is just like
captivated by it because it's the middle
of winter why on Earth would anybody be
drinking iced tea in the middle of
winter it doesn't make any sense to him
but apparently a bunch of people enjoy
it so he's like that's it I'm going to
start selling tea so the first thing Don
has to figure out is a proposition right
why would anybody drink his tea over
Snapple Snapple is already an
established brand so he starts to
thinking on how he's going to set
himself different how he's going to set
himself apart how he's going to be
better now I'm just guessing but I'm
assuming at this point he refers back to
all of his experience all of his
knowledge all of the lessons that he's
learned from marketing and distributing
beer over the past decade and when you
distill all that knowledge down he knows
that you have to make it cool and you
have to make it sexy right because sex
sells the problem is iced tea isn't
exactly an adult beverage there might be
a lot of kids drinking this beverage too
and having some model with huge cans
marketing it might be a little
aggressive for something that children
might be drinking and then it hits him
Value Proposition
huge cans we'll get rid of the model and
just keep the giant cans okay now like
the textbook business term for this
strategy is called a value proposition
basically he's decided that Snapple is
16 o and it costs like I don't know $129
whatever it costs he's coming in and
he's like cool I'm going to sell more
I'm going to sell 23 o cans and I'm
going to sell it for less I'm going to
sell it for 9 that's the value
proposition you're going to get more for
okay that's what a textbook is going to
tell you but I'm dubbing this the big
can strategy right because we've seen
this time and time again okay think
about Monster Energy Monster Energy was
not the First Energy drink to ever hit
the market that was Red Bull Monster
Energy just came along and was like oh
hey Red Bull is only selling these
little 8 oz cans of energy drinks what
if I doubled the size and sold 16 oz
cans and gave it an even cooler logo
boom multi-billion Dollar business right
out of the gate and you know the kicker
with that one of the top Executives that
helped initially launch monster and
Market it was was a top level executive
at Arizona previously so he knew exactly
what he was doing with the big can
strategy in Don vag's own words his
marketing strategy is and I quote put
tea in a big can and paint it pretty
okay if you learn nothing else from this
video just remember people like big
Big Cans
cans did you say my name no why you said
big
cans yeah well that was my nickname in
high school what yeah I didn't tell you
that that story no yeah so it all
happened back in 2009 I was a freshman
and so all these boys were just like
[Music]
all sorry what are you paying attention
yeah no I heard all of it
okay sorry anyways we've got the
Business Model
business model classic value proposition
give more More For Less super simple
easy to Market great tried andrue
business strategy next thing what are we
going to name the company so Don's
thinking on it he goes back home to his
wife and he's looking at his house and
he lives in this like Spanish Colonial
or sometimes referred to as Santa Fe
style home and he's like cool I'm just
going to call it Santa Fe T when you
think of tea you think of hot the desert
Santa Fe is perfect we're going to slap
Santa Fe On The can he does a couple of
designs the word Santa Fe just it
doesn't look right it doesn't fit so
he's like [ __ ] it I'm just going to say
Arizona te Don's never even set foot in
Arizona but he's like it's fine we're
just going to call it Arizona Tea it'll
be good sounds good to me okay next
thing got to make the cans cool Don's
wife volunteers she's going to design
all the cans perfect we got everything
we need so now da and John fero are
going to go to the bank get a loan and
start their Tea Company the bank hates
The Bank
it they think it's a horrible stupid
idea but they reluctantly end up giving
the loan anyways for a couple of reasons
one they're already successful
businessmen they already have a ton of
money in collateral and b sometimes you
just got to bet on the player and not
the game so the bank while they were
wrong they ended up making the right
decision and loaned them the money to
get started so 1992 Arizona te hits the
shelves for the first time and pretty
much is immediately outrageously
successful and from here it's pretty
much three decades of Don voltagio being
a [ __ ] gangster about absolutely
everything Don wakes up one morning
decides he wants to start selling giant
one gallon jugs of tea he starts making
the tea takes it to the distributor the
distributor is like hey this is never
going to sell at which point Don is like
cool you're never right about anything
go ahead and put it on the Shelf anyways
we'll see what happens now it's un like
every grocery store in America he
decides he wants to come out with a new
flavor of tea h and Jin sing green tea
and then he has his wife design this
beautiful can at which point he takes a
bunch of criticism like hey men are
never going to drink that tea because
it's a girly colored can at which point
he's like fine I'll just sell it to
women then fast forward a decade later
it's their best-selling flavor and
probably one of the most iconic product
designs of all time and it's all because
he had his wife's back like a complete
badass he would also get a bunch of [ __ ]
because he wasn't doing any marketing
like he had no marketing department
whatsoever to the point that whenever
companies or interviewers or news
sources ask you know hey how big is your
marketing department he would reply
pretty big about 68 in fact referring to
himself because he was the only guy that
did any marketing which honestly wasn't
The Value Proposition
much they weren't worried about product
placements and being a Super Bowl
commercial and all this other dumb [ __ ]
that all the other brands do because Don
knew that he had the value proposition
on his side he knew that he was selling
more tea for less and he was putting it
inside of a cool can and the product
would sell itself and he was absolutely
right okay fast forward to 2008 Arizona
te is huge they have their own Factory
everything's paid off they're making a
ton of money they're the number one
ready to drink tea brand in the country
at this point the company is worth over
a billion dollars and John falo who over
the past decade has become more and more
of a Quiet Partner as Dawn just kind of
took everything over and Jon just got to
you know reap the rewards he comes out
and he's like hey we could literally
sell this company and make billions of
dollars and just be retired billionaires
that wake up and do whatever the [ __ ] we
want all day every day we should sell
the company to which Don was like no
Dons Sons
absolutely not I'm not selling this
company because if I sell this company
what are my sons going to do both his
sons were his top level Executives with
him literally his right and left-hand
man and he knew that if he sold out he
wasn't going to get to hang out with his
sons because every single day Don
voltagio has a 2-hour family style lunch
with both of his sons and his wife
inside of his big ass office in his
Factory okay just so we're on the same
Family Life
page Don voltagio could have cashed out
and been a billionaire with a [ __ ]
bee and said nah I'd rather hang out
with my kids go [ __ ] yourself that is
the most gangster thing I think I've
ever heard in my entire life like
imagine how his sons feel about him
after that you know what I mean like
imagine going to work with your brother
and your dad all day every day knowing
that the only reason that you're there
right now was because your dad got
offered to be a billionaire like
basically a king or an emperor of
capitalism in America essentially like
your dad could have just been like the
guy doing whatever he wanted for the
rest of his life but no he decided he
was going to have your back instead dead
and now you get this awesome job with
your family like it's it's Dad goals to
a degree that I didn't even know existed
so this obviously leads to a little bit
of a falling out between Don and JN Jon
obviously wants to sell he wants to take
his money and run which kind of
understandable so he's like you know
what fine Don you keep your half of the
company I'm going to take my half and
I'm going to go sell it to some
investment firm or something and I'm
going to get my money and I'm going to
retire to which John vagio was like no
you're not absolutely not you were not
about to sell half of my company to some
investment firm that's is going to want
to take it public and then an army of
NBAs is going to march in here and try
to tell me how to run my business that I
built from the ground up when none of
them have accomplished anything at all
okay I'm worried about taking care of my
employees and my family and putting a
lot of tea in pretty cans and these NBAs
are going to march in here and they're
going to be worried about one thing and
that's getting a return on their
investment which is a fancy way of
saying they're trying to make money for
doing [ __ ] nothing so Don and John go
Court Battle
to court and battle it out for the next
8 years they reach a confidential
agreement outside of Court nobody knows
what it was nobody knows the terms
nobody really knows what happened all we
know is that JN got paid out a billion
dollars and now Don voltagio owns 100%
of Arizona te as of 2015 so clearly they
just paid out a billion dollars it's
been 23 years they have to raise the
price of the te right absolutely not da
is 100% against it and he's going to do
anything and everything he can to not
raise the price of the 99 cent cam what
Why Not Increase The Price
on Earth could his reasoning possibly be
you know what I'm just going to let him
tell you why not increase the price and
therefore increase the profit we're
successful we're debt free we own
everything why have people who are
having a hot time paying their rent have
to pay more for our drink maybe it's my
little way to give back this dude's just
a complete gangster I don't know what
else to tell you that dude literally has
woken up every day for the past three
decades and just told inflation to go
[ __ ] itself he's literally the only
multi-billion dollar CEO that came out
and was like you know what I'll just
make less money that is completely
unprecedented okay like I love
capitalism I think it is the greatest
system that humans have ever come up
with that being said it's got a ton of
shortcomings and it would be so much
better if everybody acted like that this
is all a complete lie because last time
I saw one at the gas station it was over
a dollar B yeah that does happen that's
Scalping Tea
actually the local store that you're at
marking the price up higher than MSRP
Arizona te still sells their product
below a dollar and recommends that they
sell it for 9 if other companies raise
it more than that Arizona can't really
do anything about it so yeah if you're
not picking up what I'm putting down I'm
trying to tell you that your local
convenience store is scalping
tea it's the world we live in so other
than Dawn simply being willing to just
make less money buy a smaller yacht if
you will what else is Arizona te doing
to cut cost to maintain this price point
Cutting Cost
over time they've done quite a few
different things one of which is they
actually changed from selling 23 oun
cans to 22 ooun cans and the reason they
did that wasn't by selling you know one
less ounce of tea is going to save us
all this money they didn't really give a
[ __ ] about the ke itself what they did
was they went to the can manufacturer
and said hey we want you to make our
cans thinner and use 40% less aluminum
so that we save a bunch of money on the
raw material end so they actually ended
up making the can a tiny bit smaller and
then making it significantly thinner all
the way around and having a different
top so that they could save a bunch of
money on the can itself in addition to
that they also figured they could save a
bunch of money on fuel by not delivering
their tea during the day to all the
different stores all their trucks run
exclusively at night okay just so we're
Traffic
all on the same page just so we're all
hearing what I'm saying in order for
Arizona te to maintain their cheap price
point for the rest of us they're also
going to make us suffer by reducing the
amount of traffic this might be my
favorite company on the planet they need
to add that to the marketing honestly
big cans pretty there's less [ __ ]
traffic okay it's a trifecta okay do you
understand how crazy that is like before
they were just saving you money but now
in order to keep saving you money
they're also being forced to save you
okay it violates the laws of physics
somehow it has to damn Neil degrass
Tyson how are you doing that physics
Terry who physics this is my new
favorite company okay I don't even drink
Arizona Tea I'm starting today okay
Conclusion
that's it that's all I got I thought for
sure Arizona te was going to be up to
something like every other company I
look into but no they're not up to
anything nefarious they're not secretly
being funded by the government it's just
Dawn voltagio the owner woke up every
day for 30 years and decided to be a
[ __ ] badass when they told him his
one gon jug of tea idea was Dumb and it
wasn't going to work he said cool I'm
going to go ahead and sell it anyways
and it worked he believed in himself
when his wife designed this awesome can
and they said nobody's going to buy it
because it's girly he said cool I'm
going to sell it anyways he believed in
his wife and he was a good husband when
it came time to sell out retire and be a
billionaire he said but then I'm not
going to get to hang out with my sons he
had his kids back he was a good dad and
when the time came to raise prices
because everybody else was doing it he
said
nah I don't need to make more money I'll
just make less he was a good person and
despite all of that despite the fact
that he did everything wrong and he put
money last as the business owner and the
guy running the show he still ended up
being a billionaire worth over6 billion
and more importantly he gets to have
lunch with both of his boys every single
day which is something I don't think any
other billionaire can say and in a lot
of ways that probably makes him the
richest man on earth so in my opinion
that's the key to Arizona te's success
don't chase the money chase the goal the
money will come after even if the goal
is something as simple as putting a lot
of tea in a big can and making it pretty
