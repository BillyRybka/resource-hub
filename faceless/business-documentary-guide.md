# Business Documentary Script-Writing Guide

> The definitive reference for writing compelling business documentary scripts in the investigative, witty style. This guide consolidates patterns from three example scripts into actionable frameworks.

## Quick Reference

### When to Use Which Hook Archetype

| Content Type | Hook Archetype | Key Signal |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Corporate injustice/controversy | **Personal Grievance** | You (or audience) were wronged by a company |
| Counterintuitive business model | **Business Mystery** | "How do they make money doing X?" |
| Founder/figure biography | **Character Reveal** | Wild backstory that defies expectations |

**Decision Tree:**
1. Is the subject a person with a crazy life story? → **Character Reveal**
2. Does the business model seem impossible/counterintuitive? → **Business Mystery**
3. Is there corporate wrongdoing or historical injustice? → **Personal Grievance**

### Core DNA (Non-Negotiable Elements)

Every script MUST have:

1. **Humanized Subjects** - Business people feel like real characters with flaws and motivations, not corporate entities
2. **Witty Interjections** - Conversational tangents, absurd comparisons, self-aware humor woven throughout
3. **Moral Extraction** - Every story distills to a lesson about business/life/values that emerges naturally
4. **Escalating Stakes** - Each segment raises the stakes or reveals something more surprising
5. **"Complete Gangster" Framing** - Portraying subjects who defy conventional wisdom as badasses, not just successful

### Voice Signature Phrases

Use these patterns to maintain the voice:

- "Do you understand how crazy this is?"
- "This dude's just a complete gangster"
- "I don't know what else to tell you"
- "Just so we're on the same page..."
- "And then it gets worse/better/crazier"
- "Okay, [subject] is not going to take no for an answer"
- "The medulla oblongata" (or equivalent running gag)

## Part 1: Hook Archetypes

### Archetype 1: Personal Grievance

**Use when**: You have a personal connection to the injustice, or the audience can viscerally relate to being wronged by a faceless entity (corporation, government, institution).

**Formula:**
1. **Personal Setup**: Establish a relatable, vulnerable situation ("I just had surgery")
2. **Simple Want**: State what you wanted to do ("All I wanted was to watch my favorite movie")
3. **Corporate Interference**: Name the entity that ruined it ("But no, Disney had to go and make it illegal")
4. **Topic Reveal**: State what you're covering ("Today we're talking about Togo")
5. **Mystery Tease**: Hint at why this matters ("And we're going to get into all of it")

**Example Breakdown (Togo/Disney):**
```
SETUP: "I just had surgery. All I wanted to do was take my pain pills and watch my favorite live action Disney movie."

INTERFERENCE: "But no, Disney had to go and make it illegal."

TOPIC: "Today we're talking about Togo."

CONTEXT DUMP: Quick history - Togo was a dog in 1925 who saved kids' lives, got shafted by history, then Disney made a movie fixing it, then deleted it.

STAKES: "You can't watch it. And we're going to get into all of it."
```

**Why It Works:**
- Creates immediate sympathy (surgery, pain pills = vulnerability)
- The injustice is personal and relatable
- "Made it illegal" creates intrigue
- Positions the narrator as advocate, not neutral reporter

**Variations:**
- **Collective Grievance**: "All WE wanted was..." (community issue)
- **Proxy Grievance**: "This dog/person got shafted and nobody talks about it"
- **Delayed Reveal**: Build up how great something was BEFORE revealing the injustice

**Key Transition**: After the hook, shift to historical context that explains WHY this matters beyond personal complaint.

---

### Archetype 2: Business Mystery

**Use when**: The economics or business model seems impossible, counterintuitive, or "too good to be true." The audience should think "they MUST be up to something."

**Formula:**
1. **Impossible Fact**: State the specific, concrete fact that doesn't make sense ("99 cents since 1992")
2. **Context That Amplifies**: Add data that makes it MORE impossible ("inflation has gone up 124%")
3. **Comparison Anchor**: Reference something familiar to show how weird this is ("even Dollar Tree is $1.25 now")
4. **Conspiracy Tease**: "They're clearly up to something"
5. **Investigation Promise**: "And we're going to get into it"

**Example Breakdown (Arizona Tea):**
```
IMPOSSIBLE FACT: "Selling these giant cans of tea for 99 cents"

AMPLIFICATION: "Right out of the gate feels weird, but then it gets even weirder when you realize they've been selling that same can for the same exact price since 1992."

DATA HAMMER: "Inflation has gone up 124% since then. That can should cost at least $2.24."

COMPARISON: "Bear in mind we live in a world where Dollar Tree is now the $1.25 Tree. The only other sacred product is the Costco $1.50 hot dog, and they lose money on it."

CONSPIRACY: "They have to be losing money. They're clearly up to something."

PROMISE: "And we're going to get into it."
```

**Why It Works:**
- Concrete numbers create credibility
- The comparison (Costco hot dog) anchors understanding
- "They're up to something" creates investigation framing
- Audience WANTS to know the answer

**Variations:**
- **Price Mystery**: How do they charge so little?
- **Scale Mystery**: How did they get so big with no marketing?
- **Survival Mystery**: How are they still in business?

**Key Transition**: Move to origin story ("Our story begins with...") to set up HOW this became possible.

---

### Archetype 3: Character Reveal

**Use when**: The subject is a person with a wild, unknown backstory that defies their public image. Works especially well when the audience thinks they know the person.

**Formula:**
1. **Knowledge Check**: Challenge what audience thinks they know ("Only 40% of Americans knew Colonel Sanders was a real person")
2. **Character Thesis**: State the real nature ("He was a complete gangster his entire life")
3. **Shocking Fact Barrage**: 5-7 rapid-fire revelations that escalate in absurdity
4. **Disbelief Acknowledgment**: "I could keep going"
5. **Investigation Promise**: "But we're going to cover all of it"

**Example Breakdown (Colonel Sanders):**
```
UNPREPARED WARNING: "There is absolutely nothing that is going to prepare you for how crazy this story actually is."

KNOWLEDGE CHECK: "According to a 2010 study, only 40% of Americans between 19-25 knew Colonel Sanders was a real person."

CHARACTER THESIS: "And even less people know that he was a complete gangster his entire life."

SHOCKING FACT BARRAGE:
- "Didn't start selling KFC till he was 66"
- "Lost his law license for beating up his own clients in open court"
- "Undefeated in gunfights"
- "Notorious adulterer who bragged about getting laid at 83"
- "KFC had to heavily edit every TV and radio ad he ever did" + clip

ESCALATION CLOSE: "And I could keep going, but we're going to cover all of it."
```

**Why It Works:**
- Challenges assumptions = instant engagement
- Each fact is more surprising than the last
- The barrage creates FOMO (must know more)
- "Complete gangster" reframes the character

**Variations:**
- **Icon Reveal**: Famous brand figure was actually insane
- **Hidden History**: Historical figure was way more interesting than taught
- **Unlikely Hero**: Person succeeded BECAUSE of their flaws

**The Fact Barrage Pattern:**
1. Unexpected career detail
2. Legal/ethical violation
3. Violence/conflict
4. Character flaw (usually sexual/moral)
5. Tangible proof (edited clips, quotes)

## Part 2: Structure Patterns

### Pattern A: Thematic Investigation (Togo Example)

**Best for**: Corporate/systemic stories where the outrage is the point

**Flow:**
```
HOOK → Personal Grievance
   ↓
HISTORICAL CONTEXT → The actual story that deserves attention
   ↓
WHY THIS MATTERS → Connect to larger theme (why narrator cares)
   ↓
THE INJUSTICE → What the corporation/system did wrong
   ↓
SYSTEMIC CRITIQUE → This is part of a larger problem
   ↓
MORAL OUTRAGE → Personal emotional response
   ↓
CALLBACK → Return to opening grievance
```

**Segment Characteristics:**
- **Jumps between timelines** freely (1925 ↔ 1995 ↔ 2019 ↔ 2024)
- **Narrator as advocate** throughout
- **Rising anger** as the video progresses
- **Structural freedom** - follows emotional logic, not chronological

**Transition Techniques:**
- "Okay, do you see why I like this movie now?"
- "And then on top of that..."
- "But it gets worse"
- "Let me explain why this is insane"

**Ending Pattern**: Return to opening situation + call for action/awareness

---

### Pattern B: Chronological Business Journey (Arizona Example)

**Best for**: Company origin stories where the founder IS the story

**Flow:**
```
HOOK → Business Mystery
   ↓
ORIGIN → How the founder started (humble beginnings)
   ↓
INSIGHT → The key realization that changed everything
   ↓
EXECUTION → How they built the business (specific decisions)
   ↓
CHALLENGES → Obstacles and how they overcame them
   ↓
VALUES TEST → Moment that revealed true character
   ↓
RESOLUTION → Answer to the opening mystery
   ↓
MORAL → What this teaches about business/life
```

**Segment Naming Convention:**
The Arizona script literally labels segments:
- "The Beginning"
- "The 1980s"
- "Value Proposition"
- "The Bank"
- "Don's Sons"
- "Family Life"
- "Court Battle"
- "Cutting Cost"
- "Conclusion"

**Key Moments to Hit:**
1. **The Insight Moment**: When they figured out their winning strategy
2. **The Doubters**: Everyone who said they were wrong
3. **The Character Test**: Moment that shows who they really are
4. **The Vindication**: Proof they were right all along

**Transition Techniques:**
- "Fast forward to [year]..."
- "But here's where it gets crazy..."
- "So now [name] is thinking..."
- "And this leads to..."

---

### Pattern C: Biography Timeline (Colonel Sanders Example)

**Best for**: Founder/figure profiles with extensive life stories

**Flow:**
```
HOOK → Character Reveal (shocking fact barrage)
   ↓
EARLY LIFE → Childhood that explains character
   ↓
CHARACTER PATTERN → Establish recurring behavior (anger, cheating, etc.)
   ↓
CAREER CHAOS → Multiple jobs/failures showing pattern
   ↓
KARMA BATTLES → Life keeps trying to stop them, they refuse
   ↓
THE TURN → When everything finally clicks
   ↓
SUCCESS → The thing they're known for
   ↓
MYTH-BUSTING → Address misconceptions (if needed)
   ↓
LATE LIFE → How they ended up
   ↓
MORAL → What to take from their story
```

**The Karma Framework:**
Colonel Sanders script uses "Karma" as a personified antagonist:
- "Karma finally catches up to him"
- "Karma kicks in again"
- "Colonel Sanders and Karma are now in a shootout"
- "Karma is just trying to shut this guy down"

This creates narrative tension in what could be a dry biography.

**Running Gag Placement:**
- "The medulla oblongata" - used whenever violence/anger appears
- Creates callbacks that build humor
- Signals to audience "here we go again"

**Myth-Busting Segment Pattern:**
When addressing sensitive topics:
1. Acknowledge the myths exist
2. State them clearly
3. Debunk with specific evidence
4. Explain likely origin of myth
5. Clarify what IS true about the flaws
6. Move on without dwelling

Example: "Colonel Sanders: deeply flawed, cheats on his wife, anger issues, NOT some crazy prolific racist."

---

## Part 3: Humor & Voice

### Humor Types (with examples)

**1. Absurd Comparisons**
Take a real situation and compare it to something ridiculous:
- "This is like if Costco only sold hot dogs"
- "Your local convenience store is scalping tea"
- "It's the most southern thing that's ever happened, ever"
- "The only thing that could make this movie more of a fat electrician video is if Togo had bad eyesight and lied on his eye exam"

**2. Running Gags**
Repeat a joke that builds each time:
- "The medulla oblongata" (every time anger/violence appears)
- "Complete gangster" (every time subject does something badass)
- "Big cans" double entendre in Arizona script

**3. Self-Aware Tangents**
Acknowledge when you're going off-topic:
- "I'm getting sidetracked here"
- "Sorry, what were you saying?"
- "This started as a KFC video. It just turned into a Colonel Sanders video"

**4. Direct Audience Address**
Break the fourth wall:
- "Do you understand how crazy this is?"
- "Are you picking up what I'm putting down?"
- "Just so we're on the same page..."
- "Look at me. Look at me. That is a [expletive] excuse."

**5. Specificity Humor**
Precise details that are inherently funny:
- "great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandson"
- "What if instead we cast Anne Hathaway to be Leonard Sephila and then we made Togo be a pug"
- "Oh, I know a little about it" (on being a midwife)

**6. Escalating Absurdity**
Each item in a list gets more ridiculous:
- "He worked for the railroad. He used to be a lawyer until he lost his law license for beating up his own clients. He used to be involved in turf wars with bootleggers. He has been in, won, and is undefeated in gunfights. He is a notorious adulterer that bragged about getting laid at 83."

**7. Understated Delivery**
Say something shocking in a casual tone:
- "Which brings me to his next side gig after being a midwife, which was being a vampire hunter. No, I'm just kidding. But the fact that you believed me for a second speaks volumes."
- "So like a like a rational adult, he decides to go to court. No, I'm just kidding. He concocts a plan to kidnap the kids."

### Voice Patterns

**Conversational Authority:**
- Use "Okay" to signal topic shifts
- Use "Okay here's the deal" to establish facts
- Use "Look," for emphasis
- Use "I mean," before observations

**Building Incredulity:**
- "This is completely unprecedented"
- "I've never heard anything like this"
- "This dude literally..."
- "I don't know what else to tell you"

**Character Descriptions:**
- "Complete gangster"
- "Complete badass"
- "Absolute legend"
- "This dude just woke up every day and decided to..."

**Emotional Escalation Markers:**
- "But then it gets worse"
- "And if that wasn't cool enough"
- "But here's the kicker"
- "This is where it gets absolutely insane"

### When to Get Serious

**The Arizona Script Serious Moment:**
When discussing why Don won't raise prices:
> "Why not increase the price and therefore increase the profit? 'We're successful. We're debt free. We own everything. Why have people who are having a hard time paying their rent have to pay more for our drink? Maybe it's my little way to give back.'"

The humor STOPS. Direct quote. No commentary. Let it land.

**The Colonel Sanders Myth-Busting:**
> "Colonel Sanders has plenty of character flaws. However, there are humongous myths on the internet that he was a prolific racist... I have searched and scoured. There is no historical evidence to actually prove this."

Direct, factual, no jokes. Then immediately signals return to normal:
> "Colonel Sanders: deeply flawed, cheats on his wife, anger issues, NOT some crazy prolific racist. However, that's not going to stop Karma from coming for him."

**Pattern**: Serious moments are SHORT, FACTUAL, and immediately followed by a transition back to the normal voice.

## Part 4: Character Building

### Making Business People Compelling

**Technique 1: Frame Decisions as Character Moments**

Instead of: "The company decided not to sell"
Write: "When offered billions to sell, Don said 'Nah, I'd rather hang out with my kids.' Go [expletive] yourself."

Instead of: "He started a restaurant"
Write: "At the age of 65, Colonel Sanders, not taking no for an answer, throws his pressure cooker in the trunk, Claudine hops in the car, and they just go from town to town to failing restaurant, sleeping in their car."

**Technique 2: Specific Details That Humanize**
- "Don has a 2-hour family lunch with both sons every day in his office"
- "His wife designed all the cans"
- "At one point, Togo jumped through the kitchen window"
- "He was equally concerned about the furniture as he was about the kids"

**Technique 3: Show the Doubt, Then the Defiance**
Pattern: Everyone said X → Subject said "Cool, I'm going to do Y anyway" → They were right

Examples:
- "Bank said it's a horrible idea → They reluctantly loaned the money → Immediately outrageously successful"
- "Critics said men won't drink girly cans → 'Cool, I'll sell it to women then' → Best-selling flavor"
- "Everyone said the jug idea was dumb → 'Put it on the shelf anyway' → Now in every grocery store"

### The "Complete Gangster" Characterization

**When to Use:**
- Subject defied conventional wisdom and won
- Subject chose principle over money
- Subject had their family's/employees' backs
- Subject told someone powerful to go to hell

**How to Deploy:**
1. Set up the stakes (what was at risk)
2. Show what the "normal" choice would be
3. Reveal their actual choice
4. Deliver the "gangster" verdict

Example:
> "Don voltagio could have cashed out and been a billionaire with a [expletive] B, and said 'Nah, I'd rather hang out with my kids.' Go [expletive] yourself. That is the most gangster thing I think I've ever heard in my entire life."

### Showing Flaws That Humanize

**Colonel Sanders:**
- Anger issues (beaten up clients, chair incident at 70)
- Serial cheating ("tomcatting")
- Obsessed with furniture (?)
- Refused to stop cussing

**Don Voltagio:**
- Stubborn to the point of 8-year court battle
- Literally no marketing ("about 6 feet" - referring to himself)

**Togo:**
- Rebellious and untrainable as a puppy
- Spoiled by the wife

**Pattern**: Flaws make success more impressive, not less. Frame them as "despite X" or "because of X."

---

## Part 5: Conclusions & Morals

### Extracting the Lesson Naturally

**Method 1: Answer the Opening Question (Arizona)**
```
HOOK: "They're clearly up to something"
JOURNEY: Full story
ANSWER: "They're not up to anything nefarious. It's just Don Voltagio, the owner, woke up every day for 30 years and decided to be a [expletive] badass."
MORAL: "Don't chase the money, chase the goal. The money will come after."
```

**Method 2: Return to the Grievance (Togo)**
```
HOOK: "All I wanted was to watch my favorite movie"
JOURNEY: Full story of injustice
CALLBACK: "All I wanted to do was come home from surgery, sit in my lazy boy, take my pain pills, and watch Leonard Sephila and Togo save a bunch of kids. But I can't."
NO MORAL: Let the outrage speak for itself
```

**Method 3: Character Summary (Colonel Sanders)**
```
HOOK: "Nothing will prepare you for how crazy this is"
JOURNEY: Full chaotic biography
SUMMARY: "Yes, he was real. Yes, all of that is true. Is he a good role model? Probably not."
MORAL: "But you have to admire his ability to push through adversity and not take no for an answer."
```

### Ending Patterns

**The Vindication Ending:**
List all the times they were right when others were wrong:
- "When they told him his idea was dumb, he said 'I'm going to go ahead and sell it anyway.' And it worked."
- "When they said nobody would buy girly cans, he said 'Cool, I'm going to sell it anyway.' He believed in his wife."
- "When it came time to raise prices, he said 'Nah.' He was a good person."

**The Reframe Ending:**
Redefine success/wealth in new terms:
> "More importantly, he gets to have lunch with both his boys every single day. Which is something I don't think any other billionaire can say. And in a lot of ways, that probably makes him the richest man on earth."

**The Open Question Ending:**
Leave the audience with something to think about:
> "Guess I gotta go get on eBay and see if I can find an old DVD copy of this movie so it's not lost forever, I guess."

**The Self-Deprecating Close:**
Acknowledge the weird journey:
> "This started as a KFC video. It just turned into a Colonel Sanders video."

## Part 6: Segment Transitions

### Transition Techniques

**Time Jumps:**
- "Fast forward to 2008..."
- "Then in 1995..."
- "By this point..."
- "For the next 5 years..."

**Escalation Signals:**
- "But here's where it gets crazy"
- "And then it gets worse"
- "And if that wasn't cool enough"
- "But that's not going to stop [person] from..."

**Topic Shifts:**
- "So now [name] is thinking..."
- "And this leads to a bit of a falling out..."
- "Which brings me to his next side gig..."

**Question Pivots:**
- "So why on earth would Disney just get rid of it?"
- "What on earth could his reasoning possibly be?"
- "Okay, so what's actually happening here?"

**Direct Address Pivots:**
- "Okay, do you see why I like this movie now?"
- "Do you understand how absolutely insane this is?"
- "Are you picking up what I'm putting down?"

### Pacing Guidelines

**Speed Up When:**
- Listing facts/credentials (Colonel Sanders barrage)
- Building to a revelation
- Covering less important transitional information
- In montage/list segments

**Slow Down When:**
- Delivering the key insight/revelation
- Emotional moments (Don refusing to sell)
- Direct quotes from subjects
- The "gangster verdict" moment

**Pause Pattern:**
Create breathing room after big moments:
- Big revelation → Short beat → "I don't know what else to tell you" → Move on
- Emotional quote → Let it land → No commentary → Transition

---

## Part 7: Myth-Busting and Tangent Handling

### The Colonel Sanders Myth-Busting Model

**Structure:**
1. **Acknowledge**: "Colonel Sanders has plenty of character flaws. However..."
2. **State the Myths**: "There are humongous myths... he was a member of the KKK... he stole the recipe from servants... he had a pet crow named Jim"
3. **Debunk Each**: "Not true. The dude grew up extremely poor, he didn't have servants."
4. **Explain Origin**: "There's just a bunch of blog posts dating back to the early 2000s"
5. **Invite Correction**: "If you have historical evidence, let me know. I'll pin the comment if I'm wrong"
6. **Clarify Actual Flaws**: "Colonel Sanders: deeply flawed, cheats on wife, anger issues, NOT some crazy prolific racist"
7. **Transition Out**: "However, that's not going to stop Karma from coming for him"

**Key Principles:**
- Be direct, not defensive
- Acknowledge real flaws to maintain credibility
- Don't dwell or moralize
- Return to the fun quickly

### Tangent Handling

**Productive Tangents** (keep them):
- The Costco hot dog comparison (builds understanding)
- The "big cans" double entendre (builds character through humor)
- The 1980s marketing era context (explains decisions)

**Acknowledge and Move On:**
- "Sorry, I'm getting sidetracked"
- "Anyway..."
- "But back to the point..."

**Fake-Out Tangents** (for humor):
> "Which brings me to his next side gig that he started after being a midwife, which was being a vampire hunter. No, I'm just kidding. But the fact that you believed me for a second speaks volumes about this guy."

## Part 8: Adapting to Content Type

### Corporate/Systemic Stories (Like Togo)
- Lead with grievance
- Position narrator as advocate
- Allow emotional escalation
- End with outrage or call to action

### Business Model Stories (Like Arizona)
- Lead with mystery
- Position narrator as investigator
- Build to character revelation
- End with wisdom/moral

### Biography Stories (Like Colonel Sanders)
- Lead with shocking revelations
- Position narrator as entertainer
- Use Karma as antagonist
- End with qualified admiration

### Hybrid Approaches
- Arizona starts as mystery, becomes biography
- Togo starts as grievance, becomes historical correction
- Sanders starts as biography, becomes business lesson

[Personal vulnerable situation]. All I wanted to do was [simple desire]. But no, [entity] had to go and [injustice]. Today we're talking about [topic]. [Brief context]. And we're going to get into all of it.
```

### Business Mystery Opening

They're clearly up to something, and we're going to get into it.

There is absolutely nothing that is going to prepare you for how crazy this story actually is. Today we're talking about [person]. According to [stat/study], only [X%] of people knew [surprising fact]. And even less people know that [character thesis]. [Rapid-fire shocking facts].
