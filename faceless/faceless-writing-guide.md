# Complete Entertainment Documentary Script Writing Guide

## Part 1: Advanced Hook Construction

### The "Impossible Situation" Opening Formula

**Step 1: Present the Contradiction**
- Use specific numbers/facts that don't make sense
- "Arizona Tea costs 99¢ and has for 30 years, despite 124% inflation"
- "Disney made a movie, then made it illegal to watch"

**Step 2: Amplify the Impossibility**
- Add context that makes it even more absurd
- "That can should cost $2.24 by now"
- "This is like the $1.50 Costco hot dog, except Costco loses money and had to buy factories"

**Step 3: Personal Stakes**
- Why YOU care about solving this
- "All I wanted was to watch my favorite movie after surgery"
- "So many people requested I look into this"

**Step 4: Investigation Promise**
- "They're clearly up to something and we're going to get into it"
- "We're going to figure out what's really happening"

### Advanced Hook Techniques

**The "Escalating Absurdity" Pattern:**
```
Basic fact → Context that makes it weird → Context that makes it impossible → Personal investment → Promise to solve
```

**Language Patterns That Work:**
- "Which right out of the gate feels weird"
- "But then it gets even weirder when you realize..."
- "This doesn't even seem feasible"
- "They have to be losing money"

## Part 2: Character Development for Real People

### The "Badass Characterization" Method

**Technique 1: Frame Decisions as Badass Moments**
Instead of: "The company decided not to sell"
Write: "When offered billions to sell, Don said 'Nah, I'd rather hang out with my kids'"

**Technique 2: Use Specific Details to Build Character**
- "Don has a 2-hour family lunch with both sons every day in his office"
- "His wife designed all the cans"
- "He told inflation to go f*** itself for 30 years"

**Technique 3: Contrast Character with Expectations**
- "This dude could have been a billionaire with a yacht, but said nah"
- "Instead of marketing department, he said 'pretty big, about 6 feet' referring to himself"

### Character Arc Development

**The "Underdog to Legend" Template:**
1. **Humble Beginnings**: "He was a truck driver delivering alcohol"
2. **First Success**: "Started his own distribution service"
3. **Smart Pivot**: "Saw Snapple in winter and thought 'that's weird'"
4. **Genius Insight**: "Put tea in a big can and paint it pretty"
5. **Badass Moments**: All the times he defied conventional wisdom
6. **Ultimate Choice**: The moment that defines their character

## Part 3: Segment-by-Segment Structure

### The "Mystery Box" Segment Format

**Each Segment Should:**
1. **Open New Question**: Just when they think they understand
2. **Provide Partial Answer**: Satisfying but incomplete
3. **Raise Stakes**: Make the outcome matter more
4. **Transition Tease**: "But here's where it gets crazy..."

### Specific Segment Templates

**"The Origin Story" Segment:**
- How they got started (humanizing details)
- Early struggles/rejections
- The moment of insight
- "And this is where [name] really figures out how to [skill]"

**"The Genius Move" Segment:**
- Present the conventional wisdom
- Show how they defied it
- Explain why everyone thought they were wrong
- Reveal why they were actually right

**"The Ultimate Test" Segment:**
- The moment that could have changed everything
- Stakes at their highest
- Character's true values revealed
- "This is the most gangster thing I've ever heard"

## Part 4: Dialogue and Voice Techniques

### Conversational Authority Patterns

**"Let's Be Real" Language:**

- "But here's where it gets insane"
- "And then it gets worse"
- "But wait, there's more"
- "This is completely unprecedented"

### Humor Integration Techniques

**Method 1: Absurd Comparisons**
- "It's like if Costco only sold hot dogs"
- "Your local convenience store is scalping tea"
- "This violates the laws of physics somehow"

**Method 2: Self-Aware Commentary**
- "I'm getting sidetracked here"
- "Sorry, what are you paying attention?"
- "This might be my favorite company on the planet"

**Method 3: Audience Interaction**
- Direct questions to audience
- Acknowledging when something sounds unbelievable
- "I know this sounds too good to be true"

## Part 5: Research-to-Script Conversion

### The "Story Mining" Process

**Step 1: Find the Human Decisions**
- Look for moments when people chose between options
- Identify decisions that seem counterintuitive
- Find choices that reveal character

**Step 2: Extract the Emotional Stakes**
- What did they stand to gain/lose?
- What were others telling them to do?
- Why did their choice matter?

**Step 3: Build Conflict Around Decisions**
- Present conventional wisdom first
- Show the pressure to conform
- Reveal their contrarian choice
- Explain why it worked

### Fact Presentation Techniques

**"Sandwich Method":**
1. Emotional setup ("Don's thinking about it...")
2. Factual information (the decision/data)
3. Emotional payoff ("This dude's just a complete gangster")

**"Show Don't Tell" for Business Facts:**
Instead of: "They reduced aluminum usage by 40%"
Write: "Don went to the can manufacturer and said 'make our cans thinner, use 40% less aluminum'"

## Part 6: Conflict Creation in Factual Stories

### The "Everyone vs. Hero" Framework

**Setup the Opposition:**

- "Everyone told him men won't drink girly-colored cans"
- "Critics said he needed a marketing department"

**Show the Hero's Response:**
- "Don was like 'cool, I'll just sell it to women then'"
- "He said 'you're never right about anything, put it on the shelf anyway'"
- "His marketing department was 'about 6 feet' - referring to himself"

### Creating Tension in Success Stories

**Method 1: The Partnership Conflict**
- Build up the partnership
- Show growing tensions
- The ultimatum moment
- The resolution that reveals character

**Method 2: The Temptation Moment**
- Present the easy path (selling out)
- Show the pressure to take it
- Reveal what they chose instead
- Explain why that choice matters

**Level 1**: "But then something incredible happened"
**Level 2**: "And if that wasn't cool enough"
**Level 3**: "But here's where it gets absolutely insane"
**Level 4**: "This is completely unprecedented"

### Specific Transition Formulas

- "The money will come after"

**Step 3: Personal Reflection**

- How it changed your perspective
- "That probably makes him the richest man on earth"

### Advanced Ending Patterns

**The "Moral Without Preaching":**
