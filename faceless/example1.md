i just had surgery All I wanted to do
was take my pain pills and watch my
favorite live action Disney movie But no
Disney had to go and make it
illegal Today we're talking about Togo
What is Togo Togo was a dog back in 1925
that saved a bunch of kids' lives And
then the newspapers gave all of the
credit to another dog by the name of
Balto And Balto ends up getting a statue
in New York City Doesn't really seem
fair And then in 1995 Steven Spielberg
and Kevin Bacon came out with an
animated movie that wasn't even slightly
historically accurate Also giving Balto
all of the credit Okay well now you're
just being a dick But then in 2019
something incredible happened Disney
came out with a liveaction movie that
was actually fairly historically
accurate that corrected the record and
gave Togo the credit that he deserved
And if that wasn't cool enough it
starred William Defoe in a dope ass
jacket And the dog that played Togo was
actually the real Togo's great great
great great great great great great
great great great great great great
great great great great great great
great great great great great great
great great great great great great
great great great great great great
great great great great great grandson
It was fantastic It was literally one of
my favorite movies ever And then in
September of 2024 Disney comes out of
left field and just does the Thanos snap
and just deletes it from history It's
just it's not a thing anymore You can't
watch it And we're going to get into all
of it right after word from our sponsor
Delete me So good news This works well
on rabbits Yeah it's 4570 government Why
do they call the government Cuz nobody
[ __ ] like the government
[Music]
Oh well I'm going to teach these rabbits
about taxes
I love that woman This video is brought
to you by Delete Me All right here's the
deal Super simple straightforward
business model You give them money they
turn around and make sure the data
brokers on the internet aren't selling
your personal information What does that
even mean Okay here's the entire
internet and every free service on the
planet inside of a nutshell Okay there's
a saying if you're not paying for the
product you are the product What that
means is pretty much anything on the
internet that you use that's a service
Whether that be Google Facebook
Instagram Snapchat all of it Okay It's
all an app So one of two things is
happening They're either going to feed
you ads and that's how that company
makes money since their service is free
or they're going to collect your
personal information then turn around
and sell it to data brokers on the
internet and then they're going to turn
around and sell it to whoever buys it
And next thing you know you're getting
17,000 rooc calls every single day And
that's where Delete Me comes in They
will look through all the major data
brokers and find the ones that are
selling your personal information and
submit opt- out requests on your behalf
And then they are legally obligated to
comply And then they'll continue to
monitor these data brokers And if they
get your information again Delete Me
will submit an opt- out request again
Basically you're paying Delete Me to get
rid of all the downsides of all of the
free stuff on the internet which I think
is absolutely worth it If you want to
check them out I'll have a link and a
discount code down below Let's get back
to the video Okay here's the deal In
1925 in a very remote town way up in
Alaska called Gnome there's an outbreak
of dtheria Now dtheria has a very high
mortality rate for kids It's literally
called the children's plague And if they
don't get an antitoxin a lot of these
kids are going to end up dying And to
make things worse it's winter It's -50°
outside And the only way to get this
antitoxin to these kids is to go to the
nearest major city 674 miles away with
dog sled teams and then bring it all the
way back to Gnome And according to the
1995 animated movie all of it was done
by a half dog halfwolf by the name of
Balto who was accompanied by his
accomplice that was a talking goose
which obviously that's all nonsense The
only thing realistic about that movie
was there was in fact a dittheria
outbreak in 1925 And there was in fact a
dog that was named Balto but he was not
halfwolf He was 100% Siberian husky And
he was bred by a guy by the name of
Leonard Sepa who's credited with
actually being the first dude to bring
Siberian huskys over to America And
Leonard Sepha is a badass in the world
of dog sleds Okay this guy has like one
of the best dog sled teams He's one of
the best breeders At one point he was in
the Winter Olympics He's winning
competitions He's like top of his game
He is one of the legends of dog sledding
And he actually ended up selling Balto
to a guy by the name of Gunnar Kasein
because Balto wasn't good enough to make
it onto his sled team He was too slow
The lead dog in his sled team for almost
a decade was a dog by the name of Togo
Togo was a very sick puppy he was the
only puppy in his litter And because he
was so sick Sepila's wife actually you
know kept the dog in the house Didn't
let him go out in the kennel and kind of
babyed this dog So once this dog was in
better health he was kind of spoiled and
he was a troublemaker and he was a
little bit rebellious and Sephila just
didn't really like him because he
wouldn't ever listen He was untrainable
And because of that Sephila ends up
selling him to be a pet for somebody
else And then one day Togo about two
weeks after being a house pet jumps
through the kitchen window and runs back
to Sephila's house and goes back to the
kennel At which point Sepha's like "Well
[ __ ] Okay I guess you're not leaving but
you're still not part of my dog sled
team." So then Sepha would go out take
his dog sled team you know training
doing events and Togo would actually dig
his way out of the kennel and run
alongside the sled team And eventually
he's like "Fuck it I guess we'll see how
good you are as a sled dog." And he ends
up being the lead dog And it Sephila
said out of all the dogs he ever had
Togo was the absolute best I'm going to
name him Togo after the admiral An
underdog named for an underdog Okay fast
forward to 1925 with the gnome dtheria
outbreak Togo is 12 years old at this
point in time Okay the average sled dog
only makes it to 8 years old Togo is 12
and he is still Sephila's lead dog Now
the serum is already on its way from all
the other sled dog teams and Sepila and
Togo are in Gnome Alaska So they're
going to send out their best guy which
is Sephila and he's going to leave to go
out and meet the other mushers And
that's on January 28th 1925 So 2 days
after Sepha leaves Sepa is going to
cover the biggest distance He has to go
170 mi to the pickup point and start
heading back And 2 days after he leaves
on January 30th another sled dog team is
going to leave and they're going to meet
Sepula He's going to hand it off and
they're going to start bringing it back
And then the next day on January 31st
another sled dog team is going to leave
and that's the one with Balto and
they're going to pick it up and bring it
back to Gnome So Sepa is doing the bulk
of the work Not only that but when Sepha
leaves because the clock is ticking
these kids are sick and they're going to
die unless they get this antitoxin
Sepila elects to take a shortcut across
the Norton Sound The Norton Sound is a
very small inlet of the Bearing Sea that
freezes over in winter but the ice is
very thin and it is not stable It is not
safe to go out on this But the clock is
ticking and Sepho's got to save these
kids So on the way there he crosses the
Norton Sound makes it to the pickup
point picks up the Serum heads back and
he's going to cross the Norton Sound
again And the Norton Sound is absolutely
terrifying It's 25 mi of just straight
ice thin ice that's cracking and
breaking apart underneath him and his
dogs the entire time Both times he does
it At one point on the way back with the
serum all of the ice ends up breaking
And Sephila and his sled team are
literally on a gigantic free floating
piece of ice And Togo because he's so
intelligent sees the closest piece of
land that he can see and brings the dogs
hauling ass across and they end up
leaping and pulling the entire sled with
them across open water lands on land and
then drags a sled with it saving the
entire run Sepila the dogs the kids
everybody Togo literally saves the day
So during his run Sppila has to go 170
mi there to pick up the serum crossing
25 mi of frozen water Comes back crosses
another 25 mi of frozen water by far and
away the most dangerous stretch of the
race and he ends up hitting 90 miles
back towards Gnome before the next sled
team ends up meeting him That guy starts
heading back towards Gnome He rides for
about a day and then Gunner and Balto
meet him and Gunner and Balto finish the
last 50 miles back into Gnome Okay just
so we're on the same page Togo and
Sephila went 260 m Balto and Gunnar went
50 but because Gunner was the last guy
to ride into Gnome he got all of the
credit along with Balto and that's all
the newspapers cared about They gave all
of the credit to those two Okay do you
understand Do you see why I like this
movie now It's literally a Fat
Electrician video but it's about a dog
and it was a movie made by Disney Okay
this is my entire mo That's the only
reason I'm popular on the internet I
find an obscure historical figure that
contributed greatly and did incredible
things and got shafted in the annals of
history and nobody talks about him and
they give all the credit to somebody
else that did less And not only that it
even had Togo had a troubled youth where
he would get in trouble ends up being a
terrific leader and then the icing on
the cake It's his last hurrah He's 12
years old He's too old to be doing this
and he gets his you know old age and
treachery moment The only thing that
could make this movie more of a fat
electrician video is if Togo had bad
eyesight and had to lie on his eye exam
to be the lead dog and he drank too much
booze That's the only thing that could
possibly make it better Got one more in
your pup And not only that it kind of
fixed the historical record in the
common zeitgeist right Because that 1995
animated movie made everybody think that
Balto did all of this by himself which
he absolutely didn't And it did it to
the degree that even today as I'm
filming this video if you go to Balto's
Wikipedia page the top line said that
Balto was Leonard Sephila's lead dog
which isn't true at all It was never
true Leonard Sephila bred him and then
sold him to somebody else because he was
too slow Leonard Sppila's lead dog was
Togo For the love of God somebody please
change that on Wikipedia Okay so you
guys get it It was a great movie just on
its own merit And then on top of that it
was fairly historically accurate There's
a couple of things wrong with it but by
and large it was pretty damn accurate So
why on earth would Disney just get rid
of it to the point that it is now
illegal to watch it Apparently when it
comes to movies or films or like digital
works of art if it's not making the
money that you wanted it to make you can
apparently just agree to never sell it
again never stream it again never profit
off of it in any way And if you're
willing to do that you can write the
entire thing off on your taxes as a loss
That's some neat trick And that's
exactly what Disney did in September of
2024 with like 25 to 30 movies getting
them a $1.5 billion tax break Okay do
you understand how absolutely insane it
is for them to be allowed to take a
perfectly good asset and intentionally
destroy it just so they get a tax write
off It shouldn't even be legal This
literally undermines the entire concept
of capitalism Okay And I'm not bashing
on capitalism I'm the most hardcore
capitalist you'll find in your entire
life But logically speaking the entire
proposition of capitalism is like okay
you're an entrepreneur You're going to
take your own money your own time You're
going to pour your blood sweat and tears
into this project your vision and you're
going to create this product and then
you're going to take it to market and if
it goes well you deserve to make a ton
of money because you're the one that
footed all of the risk And that's why we
can justify millionaires and
billionaires inside of society That's
the logic whether you agree with it or
not Hey but the flip side of that is if
you you know take the risk and pour your
blood sweat and tears into a project and
it doesn't go that great Guess what Get
[ __ ] You lose money That's how it's
supposed to go You don't get to destroy
the asset and then write the entire
thing off That's complete and utter
[ __ ] That's a
write-off That's a writeoff Yeah Do you
even know what a write-off is Do you
understand how [ __ ] up something has
to be for Disney to sigh up me into kind
of low-key advocating for taxes It's
insane Okay And where's the line Where
does this end I mean imagine if Sig
Sauer you know that company that
invented the P320 that pistol that
allegedly when you drop it it just fires
itself What if they came out and they
were like "Hey we invested millions and
millions and millions of dollars in RD
and development of this gun and we've
decided it's not working out that great
so we're just going to go ahead and
never sell it again and write the entire
project off." I'll make that deal I own
part of Bunker Branding the company that
makes all my shirts and my hats and my
merch I own a part of that company If I
walked into the warehouse in Bernie
Texas gathered up all the shirts that we
had made hauled them out to the parking
lot threw a Molotov cocktail at it
started a bonfire and roasted
marshmallows Should I be allowed to
write all of that off as a loss or am I
just an [ __ ] and an idiot I'm going
to go with the second one Okay that's
the gig That's capitalism When you win
you win big And when you lose guess what
Tough [ __ ] You [ __ ] lost The end You
don't get to hit backspace and delete
history Actually you know if you would
read the entire article Disney cites
that it costs a lot of money to house
and curate a large catalog of videos
Okay look at me Look at me That is a
[ __ ] excuse Okay how on earth would
some electrician from Iowa know that
Because me and my friends got together
and started our own streaming platform
pepperbox.tv and it's got like 73,000
subscribers and we've got a ton of
videos up on there Guess what It does
not cost that much money to have an
extra video sitting on the servers And
we also make exclusive content just for
that platform just like Disney Plus does
I would never even remotely fathom
coming up with an exclusive piece of
content paying to have it made putting
it on my platform and then it didn't get
enough views on my platform so I'd then
delete it and have it as a tax write-off
It just doesn't even make sense And if
you still don't believe me look at the
platform we're probably on right now
YouTube Any person on the planet can get
on Google start a YouTube account upload
hundreds of gigabytes worth of video not
get any views not have their channel
monetized taking up space on Google
servers and guess what YouTube's still
making a metric [ __ ] ton of
money But on top of that it gets worse
And it gets even more unethical because
a significant portion of actors and
actresses when they are agreeing on how
they're going to get paid to work to be
an actor and actress in a film they
agree that they're going to get paid
part of their salary in royalties That
means every time that video gets a view
they get a little bit of money and
that's how they make their living But
when Disney comes out and just nukes the
movie from existence so nobody can
stream it nobody can buy DVDs nobody can
watch it whatsoever guess how much money
they end up getting paid Absolutely
[ __ ] nothing Even though they put all
of the work into it But you can't do
this to me
You know how much I sacrificed Going
back to my bunker branding example if I
go into my t-shirt warehouse haul all my
t-shirts outside have a bonfire roast
marshmallows over the top of it like an
[ __ ] I don't get to turn around to my
employees and be like "Sorry guys I
didn't sell any t-shirts Go [ __ ]
yourselves You're not getting paid." No
it's not how that [ __ ] works Okay The
entrepreneur the person that's assuming
all the risk has the obligation morally
and ethically to make sure the employees
that work on a project get paid the
amount of money that was agreed upon for
that work Okay that's how capitalism
works and Disney is messing up the
entire system I can't believe how mad I
am about this dog movie Okay and the
thing that makes it worse is even if
this video goes like super viral and
Disney like wants to remake the movie
because they realize they [ __ ] up
they're going to ruin the movie Okay
Because they're going to go into some
Disney board meeting and they're going
to be like "Wow that is an incredible
story Why on earth would we get rid of
that movie We should remake the entire
thing." You know what However I don't
like the notion that there was a white
dude with a bunch of purebred Siberian
huskys What if instead we cast Anne
Hathaway to be Leonard Sephila and then
we made Togo be a pug and then on the
dog sled team there was a ferret and a
cat and some 14-year-old egirl that
thinks she's a dog Not only is Disney
ruining capitalism they're disrespecting
the memory of Togo Okay he was 12 years
old He was an old man that ran 260 mi
through a snowstorm across a frozen
[ __ ] ocean to save a bunch of kids'
lives Then he never got the credit that
he deserved for it And then Kevin Bacon
and Steven Spielberg [ __ ] up the
common zeitgeist of history making
everybody think that Bolto's punk ass
did it And then Disney comes out of left
field and they're like "You know what
We're going to fix the historical
record." And then four years after that
they nuke that from existence because it
doesn't meet the bottom line of Bob
Iger's [ __ ] spreadsheet Okay All I
wanted to do was come home from surgery
sit in my lazy boy take my pain pills
and watch Leonard Sephila and Togo save
a bunch of kids But I can't because
Disney is trying to [ __ ] up capitalism
And now I got to go get on eBay and see
if I can find an old DVD copy of this
movie so it's not lost forever I guess
