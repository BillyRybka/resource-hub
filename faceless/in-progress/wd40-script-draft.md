# WD-40 Script Draft

**HOOK**

All right, this one has been absolutely eating at me for weeks. I started looking into WD-40 thinking it would be some boring business story, right? Like, it's a can of rust spray. How interesting could it possibly be?

But then I found out that in 2018, the CEO of WD-40 literally handcuffed a briefcase to his wrist, got into an armored truck with armed guards, and drove across San Diego to move a spiral notebook to a different bank vault. And when they asked him about it, this grown man kissed the briefcase goodbye and said "I don't know if I'll ever see it again."

What the heck is in that notebook?

Turns out it's the original formula for WD-40, written by some guy in 1953, and apparently it's so secret that only ONE person on the entire planet knows the complete recipe. Not two people. Not a small team. ONE GUY.

Now bear in mind, we live in a world where Chinese manufacturers can reverse-engineer a new iPhone and have knockoffs on the street within like three weeks. Every secret formula gets leaked, every proprietary technology gets stolen, every recipe gets figured out by some food scientist with too much time on their hands.

But somehow, for over 70 years, nobody has successfully copied WD-40. And I'm not talking about making something similar - I mean every single company that's tried to make a "WD-40 killer" has failed so spectacularly that most of them don't even exist anymore.

For a product that chemists say is basically "baby oil mixed with Vaseline and the goop from inside lava lamps."

That doesn't make any sense. There's clearly something going on here that everyone's missing, and I'm gonna figure out exactly what it is.

**THE BEGINNING**

So our story starts in 1953, right in the thick of the Cold War. The U.S. government is losing their minds trying to keep up with the Soviets, and they've got this massive problem with their nuclear missiles.

The Atlas missile - which was literally America's "don't mess with us" card - had these incredibly thin metal walls. I'm talking thinner than a beer can. And these things kept rusting in the salty San Diego air, which is problematic when you're trying to prevent nuclear war.

So they contract this tiny company called Rocket Chemical. Three guys working out of a lab so small they probably had to take turns standing up. Their job? Figure out how to keep America's nuclear deterrent from literally rusting away.

Now here's where it gets good. The actual guy doing the chemistry work wasn't even one of the founders. It was this 61-year-old dude named Iver "Norm" Lawson, and he's working out of his garage at home like some kind of suburban Walter White.

And this guy is methodical as heck. Mix a formula, test it, watch it fail, try again. He does this 39 times. THIRTY-NINE TIMES. Can you imagine coming home from your day job and being like "Honey, how was your day?" "Oh, you know, another failed attempt at saving America from nuclear annihilation. What's for dinner?"

But on try number 40, something magical happens. Lawson cooks up this perfect water-displacing formula that actually works. Water Displacement, 40th formula. WD-40.

And here's the part that's gonna tick you off - you know what Lawson gets for potentially saving the world? Five hundred dollars. Five. Hundred. Dollars.

This guy hands over what's going to become a multi-billion dollar formula, and they give him what amounts to grocery money. No stock options, no royalties, no "hey thanks for creating one of the most successful products in human history." Just "here's your $500, thanks for playing."

To make it worse, most people don't even know Lawson's name because somehow history got confused and started crediting Norman Larsen, who was just the company president. Lawson died in 1967, right before WD-40 became famous, having no idea he'd basically created liquid gold.

That might be the most gangster screw-job in business history.

**THE BREAKTHROUGH**

Initially, WD-40 is just doing its job - keeping missiles from turning into expensive rust sculptures. But then something hilarious starts happening.

The engineers at Convair, the company building these missiles, start sneaking cans of this stuff home in their lunch boxes. We're talking about literal rocket scientists here, some of the smartest people in the country, and they're basically stealing industrial solvent because it's so darn useful around the house.

Think about that for a second. These guys have access to every cutting-edge chemical and material known to man, and they're like "Nah, gimme that missile juice for my squeaky door hinges."

The company president, Norm Larsen, notices this and has what might be the smartest business insight of the 1950s. He's like "Wait a minute. If rocket scientists are stealing this stuff for home use, maybe we should just... sell it to regular people?"

Revolutionary thinking right there.

So in 1958, they start putting WD-40 in little aerosol cans and selling it to hardware stores. And here's where you realize this isn't just a good product - this is crack cocaine for mechanical problems. They've got seven employees total, selling this stuff out of car trunks, and somehow they're moving 45 cases a day.

But the real breakthrough comes in 1961 with Hurricane Carla. This massive storm hits the Gulf Coast, floods everything, and the government's sitting there like "How the heck do we fix all this water-damaged equipment?"

Someone remembers the missile juice. They send an entire truckload of WD-40 down to Texas for disaster relief. And suddenly every news outlet in the country is talking about this miracle spray that can resurrect dead engines from flood damage.

Then NASA gets involved. In 1962, they're preparing to launch John Glenn into orbit, and they decide to spray his spacecraft with WD-40. Let that sink in - the first American to orbit Earth is trusting his life to a formula some guy invented in his garage to keep missiles from rusting.

If WD-40 is good enough for the space program, it's definitely good enough for your bicycle chain.

**THE GENIUS MOVE**

Now here's where most companies would completely mess this up. They'd patent the formula, expand into seventeen different product lines, hire a bunch of MBA consultants, and basically do everything Harvard Business School tells you to do when you have a hit product.

WD-40 said "Nah, we're good" and did the exact opposite of all of that.

First, they decided NOT to patent the formula. Think about how ballsy this decision is. Patents only last 20 years, then your recipe becomes public knowledge forever. But trade secrets? Those can last indefinitely, as long as you can keep your mouth shut.

It's the same strategy Coca-Cola tried, except Coca-Cola's formula has been basically figured out by every food scientist on the planet. WD-40 actually managed to keep their secret.

Then in 1969, they hire this guy John Barry as CEO. Barry's got the classic corporate resume - MIT business degree, Navy background, experience at 3M. You'd expect him to come in and "optimize" everything with fancy business strategies and market expansion plans.

Instead, Barry looks at this company and goes "You know what? We're gonna break every single rule they teach in business school."

He renames the entire company from Rocket Chemical to just "WD-40 Company." One product. That's it. No diversification, no product line extensions, no WD-41 or WD-42 or "New and Improved WD-40 with Lemon Scent."

Every business expert is telling him this is insane. You can't run a major corporation with just one product. What if demand drops? What if competitors emerge? What if the market changes?

Barry's response is basically "Watch me."

And holy crap, was he right. Under Barry's leadership, sales go from $2 million in 1969 to $91 million by 1990. The company goes public in 1973 and the stock jumps 61% on the first day because investors are like "Wait, this company makes HOW much money selling rust spray?"

Meanwhile, Barry's running board meetings at Denny's, answering his own phone, and telling everyone to call him "Jack." This dude is operating a multi-million dollar corporation like it's a corner hardware store, and somehow it's working better than companies with thousand-person management teams.

**THE SECRECY OBSESSION**

But here's where WD-40 goes from successful business to full-blown cult - the way they handle their "secret formula."

Remember that spiral notebook from 1953 with Lawson's original recipe? They treat that thing like it's the freaking Declaration of Independence. It's kept in a bank vault in downtown San Diego, and only one person at any given time knows the complete formula.

And WD-40 loves making a theatrical production out of this. That 2018 vault transfer I mentioned? The CEO literally handcuffed the briefcase to his wrist, surrounded himself with armed guards, and drove across town in an armored truck like he's transporting nuclear launch codes.

There are actual photos of this grown man kissing a briefcase goodbye. KISSING IT. Like he's sending his kid off to war.

The manufacturing process is split up across multiple facilities so no single location has the complete recipe. They've got plants in California, Louisiana, the UK, and Australia, but only a few of them can blend the concentrated mix. It's like how they handle nuclear weapons - nobody gets the whole picture.

Every employee involved in production has to sign these ironclad NDAs that probably violate several Geneva Convention protocols. In over 70 years, not a single person has leaked the formula. Not one disgruntled employee, not one industrial spy, not one death-bed confession. Do you understand how statistically impossible that is?

Either WD-40 has the most loyal workforce in human history, or they're running some kind of MK-Ultra mind control program.

**THE CULT PHENOMENON**

By the 1980s, something weird starts happening. WD-40 stops being a product and becomes something else entirely - it becomes a religion.

The company starts collecting customer stories about bizarre uses for WD-40, and I mean BIZARRE. Someone removes a python from under a bus with it. Police officers use it to slide an overweight burglar out of an air vent where he got stuck. A fisherman uses it to remove a fishhook from a guy's ear.

They eventually compile over 2,000 official uses for WD-40. TWO THOUSAND. For rust spray. There are people using this stuff to remove gum from hair, stop squeaky bed frames, keep pigeons off balconies, and clean crayon marks off walls.

At this point, WD-40 isn't competing with other rust sprays anymore. It's competing with duct tape for the title of "universal solution to everything."

The company creates a WD-40 Fan Club that gets hundreds of thousands of members. People are sending in their own weird use cases like they're contributing to some kind of crowdsourced science experiment. "Hey, I discovered use #2,001 - it removes tree sap from windshields!"

And here's the beautiful part - WD-40 is spending basically zero money on advertising. While other companies are dropping millions on Super Bowl commercials, WD-40 is just letting their customers do all the marketing for them.

Word of mouth becomes so powerful that by 1993, WD-40 is in 4 out of 5 American households. FOUR OUT OF FIVE. That's better penetration than most prescription medications.

**THE URBAN LEGENDS**

The mystique around WD-40 creates these absolutely wild urban legends that take on a life of their own.

For decades, people believed WD-40 was made with fish oil because fishermen noticed fish were attracted to lures sprayed with it. The company had to keep explaining: "No, there's no fish oil. The fish are probably just curious about the petroleum smell, or maybe they think it's food. Please stop asking us about fish."

Then there's the arthritis myth. Tabloids start running stories about elderly people spraying WD-40 on their joints for pain relief. The company has to put out official statements that are basically like "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT SPRAY WD-40 ON YOUR BODY. IT WILL NOT CURE YOUR ARTHRITIS. IT IS NOT MEDICINE. PLEASE STOP."

Someone even started a rumor that the secret ingredient was otter ejaculate. I kid you not - OTTER EJACULATE. And people believed it because the real formula is so mysterious that literally anything seems plausible at this point.

The truth is, modern chemists have analyzed WD-40 and figured out it's basically petroleum distillates, mineral spirits, and some hydrocarbons. One magazine described it as "baby oil, Vaseline, and the goop inside lava lamps." But knowing the general ingredients hasn't helped anyone recreate it successfully, because the exact proportions and specific additives remain locked in that vault.

**THE CORPORATE UTOPIA**

In 1997, this Australian guy named Garry Ridge becomes CEO and decides to turn WD-40 into some kind of corporate therapy experiment.

Ridge starts calling employees "tribe members" and referring to the whole company as "one big tribe." He implements this thing called "learning moments" - when someone messes up, instead of getting fired, the team sits around in a circle and discusses what went wrong so everyone can learn from it.

I know this sounds like Silicon Valley hippie nonsense, but somehow it actually works. Their employee engagement scores are consistently above 90%, which is basically unheard of in corporate America. Most companies are lucky to hit 30%.

The company has an Employee Stock Ownership Program, so everyone's financially invested in not screwing things up. Employee turnover is so low it's basically a statistical anomaly. When COVID hit and companies everywhere were laying people off, WD-40's team just adapted and kept those little cans flowing to store shelves like nothing happened.

Ridge's leadership philosophy is literally "Don't mark my paper, help me get an A." Which sounds cheesy as heck, but apparently when you treat people like human beings instead of productivity units, they tend to work harder and stay longer.

Who knew?

**THE IMPOSSIBLE ECONOMICS**

Here's what really makes no sense about this whole story - the economics of WD-40 are completely freaking impossible.

This is a 70-year-old product that hasn't changed since Eisenhower was president. The formula is identical, the can design is basically the same, they don't advertise, they don't have massive R&D budgets, and they actively refuse to expand into new product lines.

By every metric taught in business school, WD-40 should have been disrupted, commoditized, or made obsolete decades ago.

Instead, they're a $3 billion company in 2024 selling the exact same product they were selling when "I Love Lucy" was on TV. They're in over 190 countries. They have profit margins that make tech companies jealous.

And here's the kicker - every single company that's tried to create a "WD-40 killer" has failed spectacularly. CRC Industries, Liquid Wrench, 3-in-One Oil - they all make perfectly good penetrating oils, some arguably better for specific applications, but none of them have even dented WD-40's market share.

It's like watching a horse and buggy company somehow dominating the transportation industry in the age of Tesla.

**THE REAL SECRET**

So what's actually going on here? How does a company with one ancient product and a CEO who runs meetings at Denny's completely dominate a market that should be easy as heck to disrupt?

It's not the secret formula - chemists have basically reverse-engineered that. It's not superior technology - the product is relatively simple. It's not marketing genius - they barely advertise.

The real secret is that somewhere along the way, WD-40 stopped being a rust spray and became something much more powerful - it became a cultural institution.

When you buy WD-40, you're not buying penetrating oil. You're buying into 70 years of American mythology. You're buying the same formula that protected nuclear missiles and spacecraft. You're buying something that's been in your family's toolbox since your grandfather was alive.

WD-40 figured out something that most businesses never understand - sometimes the most powerful strategy is to do absolutely nothing different. Don't innovate, don't expand, don't fix what isn't broken. Just be consistently, reliably, perfectly what you've always been.

In a world where every product gets "disrupted" every five minutes, WD-40 represents stability. That blue and red can is a constant in an ever-changing world. And apparently, that consistency is worth billions of dollars.

**THE CONCLUSION**

That's the real genius of WD-40. They didn't just create a product - they created a tradition that gets passed down from father to son like knowledge of how to change a tire or grill a burger.

You can reverse-engineer a chemical formula, but you can't reverse-engineer 70 years of trust. You can create a better rust spray, but you can't create seven decades of cultural momentum.

And maybe that's the most gangster business move of all - convincing three generations of Americans that they absolutely need a 70-year-old missile lubricant, and then keeping the recipe secret just because you freaking can.

So there you have it. One guy in a garage got paid 500 bucks to mix chemicals until he accidentally created the most beloved household product in American history. A CEO decided to break every business rule ever written and somehow built a billion-dollar empire. And a company turned industrial rust spray into a cultural phenomenon by doing absolutely nothing except staying exactly the same.

Sometimes the most incredible stories are hiding in the most ordinary places. Like that blue and red can sitting in your garage right now, guarding its 70-year-old secret and laughing at every company that's tried to knock it off its throne.

Turns out the real secret ingredient was capitalism all along.
