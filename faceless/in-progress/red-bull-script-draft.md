## [HOOK]

Okay so I need somebody to explain to me how any of this makes sense. Red Bull—the energy drink company that's literally everywhere, owns like half of Formula 1, pays people to jump out of space, has their logo on everything—Red Bull was invented by a Thai guy whose dad raised ducks. Like, actual ducks. On a farm. In rural Thailand.

And then some Austrian dude who spent his entire career selling toothpaste tried it on a business trip, and the two of them just... shook hands, split the company basically 50/50, and then apparently decided to never really talk to each other for the next forty years.

And it worked.

Okay I need you to understand how insane that is. That's not how business partnerships work. Business partnerships are messy. There's supposed to be drama. One guy screws over the other guy, lawyers get involved, somebody writes a tell-all book, there's a Netflix documentary where they interview the bitter ex-partner. That's how this goes.

These two? Nothing. Forty years of just... vibes. Good vibes apparently. One of them stayed in Thailand and—I swear to God I'm not making this up—went back to raising ducks as a hobby after becoming a billionaire. The other one stayed in Austria buying Formula 1 teams and soccer clubs and paying Felix Baumgartner to jump from the edge of space.

Neither of them ever gave interviews. The Thai guy—Chaleo Yoovidhya—didn't talk to press for the last thirty years of his life. Thirty years of "no comment." The Austrian guy—Dietrich Mateschitz—maybe gave like five interviews total in his entire career. There's no documented quote of either one of them calling the other one a friend. Not business partner, not colleague—friend. Not once. In forty years.

And somehow this becomes a company selling almost thirteen billion cans a year making like eleven billion euros in revenue.

They're clearly up to something and we're going to get into it right after a word from our sponsor.

## [The Duck Farmer's Son]

Okay our story begins in 1923 in some village in central Thailand that I'm definitely going to butcher—Ban Khao Chang in Phichit Province—and a kid named Chaleo Yoovidhya is born to a family of Chinese immigrants who basically fled Hainan with nothing. His dad raised ducks and traded fruit. That was it. That was the whole family business. Ducks and fruit.

And when I say poverty I mean like—we're not talking "we didn't have a lot of money" poverty, we're talking actual poverty. Chaleo had basically no formal education. Dropped out early because somebody had to help feed five kids. By his twenties he's migrated to Bangkok and he's working as a bus conductor. Which in 1940s Thailand was the "I have literally nothing and no skills" entry-level job. That was rock bottom.

So he bounces around. Helps his brother run a pharmacy. Becomes an antibiotics salesman. Learns pharmaceutical stuff from the ground up. And in 1962 he starts his own company—TC Pharmaceutical—out of some rented space on an alley in Bangkok making antibiotics and medications for kids.

Now here's where this guy figures something out. There's this Japanese energy drink called Lipovitan D that's dominating Thailand's market right? But it costs a fortune. Only the urban elite can afford it. And Chaleo looks at this and goes "okay wait a minute—who actually needs energy drinks? Truck drivers. Construction workers. Rice farmers. People doing manual labor. And none of them can afford this stuff."

So in 1976 he creates his own version. Calls it Krating Daeng—which means "Red Gaur," it's this wild bovine thing they have in Southeast Asia—and he sells it for like 30 cents a bottle. He sponsors Muay Thai boxing matches. Hands out free samples to truck drivers at provincial markets. Does these bottle cap prize raffles where you can win stuff.

And within two years it's the best-selling energy drink in Thailand.

This dude looked at an entire market, went "you're all charging too much and selling to the wrong people," undercut everybody, and just dominated. Complete gangster.

But okay here's the thing that kills me. After all this success, after building a fortune, Chaleo just... stays exactly who he was. Never gives interviews. No public appearances. No flashy lifestyle. And in his free time—I need you to really hear this—in his free time, the billionaire pharmaceutical mogul goes back to raising ducks.

I'm going to say that again because I don't think you heard me. This man went from duck farmer's son with no education to billionaire, and his hobby was running a private duck farm. That's either the most zen thing I've ever heard in my life or he was trolling everybody for fifty years and I genuinely cannot tell which one it is.

His son said he never heard his father use words like "difficult" or "impossible." Never complained about being tired. Just worked.

Okay that's the Thai side of this story. Now we need to talk about the Austrian toothpaste guy.

---

## [The Toothpaste Guy]

Alright so meanwhile in Austria we have Dietrich Mateschitz. Born 1944, some small town in Styria, parents were both school teachers who later split up.

Now here's a fun fact that I think really sets the tone here. Mateschitz took ten years to complete his marketing degree at Vienna University. Ten years. He was working as a ski instructor and doing random labor jobs between classes. Just really taking his time with the whole higher education thing. No rush. We'll get there when we get there.

After he finally graduates in 1972, he works at Unilever for a bit, then Jacobs Coffee, and eventually lands at this German cosmetics company called Blendax where he becomes the Director of International Marketing for... toothpaste.

Okay I need you to sit with that for a second. The man who would go on to create the entire energy drink category in the Western world, who would build one of the most valuable private companies on Earth, who would own Formula 1 teams and a media empire—this guy's job was selling toothpaste. I don't know what to tell you. That's just what happened.

Now here's the connection. TC Pharmaceutical—Chaleo's company in Thailand—was Blendax's distributor in Thailand. So Mateschitz is traveling to Bangkok regularly for business. And on one trip in 1982, he's jet lagged out of his mind, and somebody gives him this local energy tonic.

The official story Red Bull tells is that jet-lagged Austrian marketer randomly discovers Thai wonder drink and his whole life changes. Which is kind of true but also—he already knew the Yoovidhya family through business. This wasn't completely random. He was already in their orbit.

Either way, he tries the drink—at the airport, in a taxi, at some hotel, depends on who's telling the story—and supposedly the jet lag just disappears. "One glass and the jet lag was gone."

But here's what really got him. Mateschitz had read somewhere that Taisho Pharmaceutical—the company that makes Japan's version of this stuff, Lipovitan D—was Japan's largest corporate taxpayer. Largest. In the whole country. And he realizes there's nothing like this in Western markets. Nothing.

So this toothpaste marketing guy reads about Japanese energy drink tax receipts and goes "huh, I should probably invent an entire product category."

Just absolutely unhinged confidence. I respect it.

## [The Partnership]

The negotiations take two years. In 1984, Red Bull GmbH gets established in Fuschl am See, Austria. Both men put in $500,000 each—which was serious money, real personal risk for both of them.

And the ownership structure is actually pretty elegant. 49% to Chaleo. 49% to Mateschitz. And 2% to Chaleo's eldest son Chalerm. Which means the Thai family has 51% control—technically majority owners—but Mateschitz gets full operational authority to actually run the thing in Western markets.

Now part of this was legal—Thailand's Foreign Business Act required majority Thai ownership for companies to avoid getting screwed by restrictions. But beyond the legal stuff, this arrangement only works if these two guys actually trust each other. And apparently they did.

Here's what makes this partnership absolutely insane though. The division of labor was complete. Like, surgically separate. No overlap whatsoever.

Chaleo kept the original formula, managed all the Asian operations, oversaw production. Fun fact—the flavoring for every can of Red Bull sold anywhere in the world is still manufactured in Thailand and exported. That's Chaleo's side.

Mateschitz took everything else. Reformulated the drink for Western tastes, created the marketing strategy, managed global expansion.

And the changes Mateschitz made were substantial. The original Krating Daeng was flat, syrupy, super sweet, sold in these little brown glass bottles that looked like medicine. Very much a "this tastes like health" situation.

Red Bull became carbonated, less sweet, packaged in those distinctive slim silver-blue cans, and positioned as a premium lifestyle product instead of a working-class pick-me-up. Same core ingredients—caffeine, taurine, B vitamins—but completely different identity.

And here's the part that gets me. Evidence of their personal relationship is just... remarkably thin. Both of them were extreme recluses. No documented quotes of either one discussing the other as a friend. No public tribute from Mateschitz when Chaleo died in 2012. No evidence they visited each other regularly or hung out or did anything beyond business necessities.

The partnership worked because of complementary expertise and mutual trust. Not personal intimacy. Just... staying in their lanes. For forty years.

## [Three Years of Failure]

Okay so Red Bull launches in Austria on April 1st, 1987. April Fool's Day. Which in retrospect might have been appropriate because the first few years were an absolute disaster.

Market research firms had universally panned the product. Focus groups tried it and said it was disgusting. Marketing experts predicted certain failure. Mateschitz later said these were the most difficult years of his life.

The company lost over a million dollars in its first two years. No outside investors would touch them because Western financial institutions just could not wrap their heads around expensive energy drinks being a thing. "Why would anyone pay premium prices for this? It tastes weird. Pass."

And the regulatory situation was a nightmare. Germany banned Red Bull for years because they were freaked out about taurine. France maintained a twelve-year ban—from 1996 to 2008. Denmark classified it as a medicinal product that could only be sold in pharmacies.

But here's where it gets interesting. The bans actually helped.

German clubbers started smuggling Red Bull across the Austrian border. I'm serious. People were running energy drink contraband because they couldn't get it legally in Germany. And that created this underground demand, this forbidden fruit mystique.

The real breakthrough came through nightclubs and the rave scene. Young people figured out that Red Bull mixed with vodka was basically rocket fuel for all-night dancing. And they just... told each other. Word spread organically. "You gotta try this stuff they're smuggling in from Austria."

Mateschitz's marketing genius was in what he didn't do. He didn't do traditional advertising. At least not at first.

Instead he pioneered this guerrilla stuff—paying popular university students to throw parties, leaving empty Red Bull cans in trendy nightclub trash bins to make it look like everyone was already drinking it, deploying these branded Mini Coopers with giant Red Bull cans mounted on the roof driving around cities.

He was spending 25-30% of revenue on marketing. Which is insane. No public company could ever do that—shareholders would riot. But Red Bull wasn't public. He didn't have to answer to anyone demanding quarterly returns.

His whole philosophy was: "When we first started, we said there is no existing market for Red Bull. But Red Bull will create it."

Do you understand how unhinged that is? He wasn't selling a beverage. He was selling a lifestyle. Creating events instead of sponsoring them—Red Bull Flugtag in 1992, Red Bull Air Race, Red Bull Cliff Diving. Eventually Red Bull Media House in 2007, producing actual professional content—documentaries, extreme sports coverage, music stuff—that just happened to feature the brand.

Three years of failure. Then thirty-seven years of absolute dominance.

---

## [The Gangster Move]

Okay so Red Bull's decision to never go public is really the key to understanding why this worked.

Both families had opportunities to IPO. We're talking about offers that would have generated billions in immediate cash. And both of them just said no. Turned down free money. Multiple times.

For the first fifteen years of the company, all profits got reinvested. No dividends. Nothing. Just pour it all back in. Which let them spend stupid amounts on marketing that no publicly traded competitor could ever match.

The company carried zero debt. Financed everything from retained earnings. And production costs stayed insanely low—about nine cents per can, sold wholesale for almost two bucks in Western markets. The margins on this stuff are absolutely ridiculous.

Just so we're on the same page here: from $500,000 each invested in 1984, both families ended up with multi-billion dollar fortunes.

Chaleo was worth $5 billion when he died in 2012. Third richest person in Thailand. Mateschitz was worth $27.4 billion when he died in 2022. Richest person in Austria.

Today the Yoovidhya family collectively holds somewhere between $36 and $44 billion. The company makes €11.2 billion in annual revenue. Red Bull has 43% of the global energy drink market.

And neither founder ever sought credit, ever gave interviews, ever wanted to be famous. They just... made energy drinks and stayed out of each other's way. Let each other operate. Trusted the structure.

That is the most gangster partnership arrangement I think I've ever heard of in my entire life.

---

## [The Scandal]

Okay I do need to address something here because any complete story has to include this.

Vorayuth Yoovidhya—Chaleo's grandson, goes by "Boss"—was involved in a 2012 hit-and-run case that became basically Thailand's defining symbol of elite impunity.

I'm not going to go super deep on this because it's really a whole separate story, but short version: police officer was killed, Boss fled the country, charges either expired or got dropped, and prosecutors were later actually convicted of altering evidence. He's still a fugitive, believed to be in London or Europe somewhere, keeps getting spotted at Formula 1 events despite having an Interpol Red Notice out on him.

It did real damage to the family's reputation in Thailand. During 2020 pro-democracy protests, demonstrators were carrying Red Bull logo cutouts as symbols of injustice.

But this is important context: Vorayuth never had any role in Red Bull's actual management or operations. The extended family distanced themselves and TCP Group issued a rare public apology.

The scandal is about Thai elite impunity. It's not really about the Red Bull business partnership. Those are separate things.

---

## [The Legacy]

Both founders planned their successions carefully.

After Chaleo died in 2012, his estate went to his eleven surviving children. His eldest son Chalerm became the family patriarch, holding that key 2% stake. Another son, Saravoot, became CEO of TCP Group, running the Thai business empire.

Mateschitz's situation was simpler. His only son Mark—born 1992—inherited the 49% stake when his dad died in October 2022. Mark was 30 years old and immediately became one of the youngest billionaires in Europe.

But unlike the Thai family's hands-on approach, Mark stepped back from operations. His quote was: "I do not believe one should be both an employee and a shareholder of the same company." Which, fair enough honestly.

New management came in—Franz Watzlawick as CEO for beverages, Oliver Mintzlaff handling projects and investments including F1.

Business keeps thriving. Red Bull Racing won F1 championships in 2022 and 2023 with Max Verstappen. Revenue hit records in 2024. The partnership structure, now four decades old, shows zero signs of falling apart.

## [CONCLUSION]

So what's the actual lesson here?

Look, the temptation when telling this story is to find the drama. Find the conflict between founders. Find the resentment over who gets credit. Find the East versus West tension. That's what makes a good story, right?

But the evidence just doesn't support that narrative.

What the evidence actually supports is something almost boring: complementary strengths.

Chaleo Yoovidhya had product innovation genius, manufacturing expertise, and deep understanding of his market. Dietrich Mateschitz had marketing brilliance, Western market knowledge, and the drive to build global operations.

Neither one of them wanted what the other one had. Neither one resented the other's domain. They just... did their thing.

The 51/49 structure worked because it was clear. Thai family had control. Austrian ran operations. Profits flowed both directions. Everybody got rich. Spectacularly rich. And nobody ever seriously tried to renegotiate, which suggests both sides knew they had a good deal.

The privacy thing wasn't eccentricity—it was strategic. Cultural. Authentic to who these guys actually were. They built one of the most visible brands on the planet while being almost completely invisible themselves.

The real lessons here are about patience—three years of losses before success, fifteen years reinvesting profits. Trust—letting your partner operate autonomously in their domain. Complementarity—different skills for different problems. And private ownership—making decisions for decades instead of quarters.

Two private men from opposite ends of the Earth—one a Thai duck farmer's son with no education, one an Austrian who took ten years to finish a marketing degree—recognized they had complementary strengths, trusted each other enough to stay in their lanes for forty years, and built one of the most valuable private companies in the world without ever seeking recognition or apparently even developing a close personal friendship.

Red Bull's success wasn't despite their distance. It was because of it.

And honestly? Both of them got to do exactly what they wanted. Chaleo got to run his duck farm. Mateschitz got to buy sports teams and send people to space. Neither one ever had to answer to shareholders, give interviews, or pretend to be something they weren't.

That's probably the most successful partnership in modern business. Not because they built a great company—though they did. But because they both got exactly the life they wanted out of it.
